[NOTE]
====
Neo4j uses the AWS SDK v2 to call the APIs on AWS using AWS URLs.
Alternatively, you can override the endpoints so that the AWS SDK can communicate with alternative storage systems, such as Ceph, Minio, or LocalStack, using the system variables `aws.endpointUrls3`, `aws.endpointUrlS3`, or `aws.endpointUrl`, or the environments variables `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` or `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`.
