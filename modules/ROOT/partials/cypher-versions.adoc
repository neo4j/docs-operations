== CypherÂ® versions

Starting from Neo4j 2025.06, Cypher language introduces a new version Cypher 25.
Cypher 5 will continue to be the default version for all newly-created databases, however, new features will be added only to Cypher 25.
For more information about the Cypher versioning, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/25/queries/select-version/[Cypher Manual -> Select Cypher version].

You can specify the version of Cypher in which you want to run your queries (Cypher 5 or Cypher 25) by configuring a default Cypher version for the whole DBMS, per database, or by setting it on a per-query basis.
For details, see the xref:configuration/cypher-version-configuration.adoc[].
