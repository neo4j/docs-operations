== CypherÂ® versions

In Neo4j 2025.06, the Cypher language has been decoupled from the Neo4j server versioning and now has its own versioning system.
You can choose between Cypher 5 and Cypher 25.
Cypher 5 is the version that has been in use in Neo4j up to and including version 2025.06.
It will remain the default version for all newly created databases but will not receive new features.
All new features and improvements will be introduced in Cypher 25.
For more information about the Cypher versioning, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/25/queries/select-version/[Cypher Manual -> Select Cypher version].

You can specify the version of Cypher in which you want to run your queries (Cypher 5 or Cypher 25) by configuring a default Cypher version for the whole DBMS, for a database, or by setting it on a per-query basis.
For details, see the xref:configuration/cypher-version-configuration.adoc[].
