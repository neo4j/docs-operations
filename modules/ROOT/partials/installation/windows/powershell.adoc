[[powershell]]
= Windows PowerShell module

The Neo4j PowerShell module allows administrators to:

* Install, start and stop Neo4j Windows® Services.
* Start tools, such as `Neo4j Admin` and `Cypher Shell`.

The PowerShell module is installed as part of the link:https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/[ZIP file] distributions of Neo4j.


[[powershell-requirements]]
== System requirements

* Requires PowerShell v2.0 or above.
* Supported on either 32 or 64 bit operating systems.


[[powershell-windows]]
== Managing Neo4j on Windows

On Windows, it is sometimes necessary to _Unblock_ a downloaded ZIP file before you can import its contents as a module.
If you right-click on the ZIP file and choose "Properties" you will get a dialog which includes an "Unblock" button, which will enable you to import the module.

Running scripts has to be enabled on the system.
This can, for example, be achieved by executing the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
----
For more information, see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847748.aspx[About execution policies].

The PowerShell module will display a warning if it detects that you do not have administrative rights.


[[powershell-module-import]]
== How do I import the module?

The module file is located in the _bin_ directory of your Neo4j installation, i.e. where you unzipped the downloaded file.
For example, if Neo4j was installed in _C:\Neo4j_ then the module would be imported like this:

[source,powershell]
----
Import-Module C:\Neo4j\bin\Neo4j-Management.psd1
----

This will add the module to the current session.

Once the module has been imported you can start an interactive console version of a Neo4j Server like this:

[source,powershell]
----
Invoke-Neo4j console
----

To stop the server, issue `Ctrl-C` in the console window that was created by the command.


[[powershell-help]]
== How do I get help about the module?

Once the module is imported you can query the available commands like this:

[source,powershell]
----
Get-Command -Module Neo4j-Management
----

The output should be similar to the following:

[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
CommandType     Name                                Version    Source
-----------     ----                                -------    ------
Function        Invoke-Neo4j                        {neo4j-version-exact}      Neo4j-Management
Function        Invoke-Neo4jAdmin                   {neo4j-version-exact}      Neo4j-Management
Function        Invoke-Neo4jBackup                  {neo4j-version-exact}      Neo4j-Management
Function        Invoke-Neo4jImport                  {neo4j-version-exact}      Neo4j-Management
Function        Invoke-Neo4jShell                   {neo4j-version-exact}      Neo4j-Management
