By default, Neo4j Community Edition does not include graph tools such as visualization, data exploration, and monitoring.
However, you can use the Neo4j Aura console to access these features for free.
No subscription is required.

You are now connected and can use the Aura Console to run Cypher queries, visualize graphs, and optionally monitor your local Neo4j database in Neo4j Aura.
For details, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/#_work_with_data[Get started with Neo4j].
