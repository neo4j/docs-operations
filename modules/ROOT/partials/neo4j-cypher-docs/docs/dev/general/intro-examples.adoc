Let's create a simple example graph with the following query:

include::includes/intro.query-1.adoc[]
.Example Graph
include::includes/intro.graph-1.adoc[]

For example, here is a query which finds a user called *'John'* and *'John's'* friends (though not his direct friends) before returning both *'John'* and any friends-of-friends that are found.

include::includes/intro.query-2.adoc[]

Resulting in:

include::includes/intro.result-1.adoc[]

Next up we will add filtering to set more parts in motion:

We take a list of user names and find all nodes with names from this list, match their friends and return only those followed users who have a *'name'* property starting with *'S'*.

include::includes/intro.query-3.adoc[]

Resulting in:

include::includes/intro.result-2.adoc[]
