== Importing large amounts of data ==
If the CSV file contains a significant number of rows (approaching hundreds of thousands or millions), `USING PERIODIC COMMIT` can be used to instruct Neo4j to perform a commit after a number of rows.
This reduces the memory overhead of the transaction state.
By default, the commit happens every 1000 rows.
Note that `PERIODIC COMMIT` is only allowed in <<query-transactions, implicit (auto-commit or `:auto`) transactions>>.
For more information, see <<query-using-periodic-commit-hint>>.

Note: The <<query-use, `USE` clause>> can not be used together with the `PERIODIC COMMIT` query hint.

Note: Queries with the `PERIODIC COMMIT` query hint can not be routed by <<operations-manual#causal-clustering-routing, Server-side routing>>.
