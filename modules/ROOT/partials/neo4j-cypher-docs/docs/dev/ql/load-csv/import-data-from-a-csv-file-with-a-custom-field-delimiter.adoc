== Import data from a CSV file with a custom field delimiter ==
Sometimes, your CSV file has other field delimiters than commas.
You can specify which delimiter your file uses, using `FIELDTERMINATOR`.
Hexadecimal representation of the unicode character encoding can be used if prepended by `{backslash}u`.
The encoding must be written with four digits.
For example, `{backslash}u003B` is equivalent to `;` (SEMICOLON).
