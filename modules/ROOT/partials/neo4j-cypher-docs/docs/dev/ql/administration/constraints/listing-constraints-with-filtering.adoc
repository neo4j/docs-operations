== Listing constraints with filtering ==

One way of filtering the output from `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` by constraint type is the use of type keywords,
listed in <<administration-constraints-syntax-list>>.
For example, to show only unique node property constraints, use `SHOW UNIQUE CONSTRAINTS`.
Another more flexible way of filtering the output is to use the `WHERE` clause.
An example is to only show constraints on relationships.

This will only return the default output columns.
To get all columns, use `SHOW INDEXES YIELD * WHERE ...`.
