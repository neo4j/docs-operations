== Create a composite b-tree index for relationships ==
A named b-tree index on multiple properties for all relationships with a particular relationship type -- i.e. a composite index -- can be created with `CREATE INDEX index_name FOR ()-[r:TYPE]-() ON (r.prop1, ..., r.propN)`. Only relationships with the specified type and that contain all the properties in the index definition will be added to the index. Note that the composite index is not immediately available, but is created in the background. The following statement will create a named composite index on all relationships labeled with `PURCHASED` and which have both a `date` and `amount` property:
