== Listing indexes with filtering ==

One way of filtering the output from `SHOW INDEXES` by index type is the use of type keywords,
listed in the <<administration-indexes-syntax, syntax table>>.
For example, to show only b-tree indexes, use `SHOW BTREE INDEXES`.
Another more flexible way of filtering the output is to use the `WHERE` clause.
An example is to only show indexes not belonging to constraints.
