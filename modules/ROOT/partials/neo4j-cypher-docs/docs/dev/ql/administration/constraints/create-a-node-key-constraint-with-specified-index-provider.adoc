== Create a node key constraint with specified index provider ==
To create a node key constraint with a specific index provider for the backing index, the `OPTIONS` clause is used.
Valid values for the index provider are `native-btree-1.0` (deprecated), `lucene+native-3.0` (deprecated), and `range-1.0` (future index), default is `native-btree-1.0`.
The index type of the backing index is set depending on the provider, the `range-1.0` generates a <<indexes-future-indexes, future range index>> while the other providers generates a b-tree index.
In 4.4, b-tree index-backed constraints are still the correct alternative to use.

B-tree providers can be combined with specifying index configuration.
