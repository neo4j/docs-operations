|Type        | Description                                                     | Usage                              | Developing
|Scalar      | For each row the function takes parameters and returns a result | <<query-functions-udf, Using UDF>> | <<java-reference#extending-neo4j-functions, Extending Neo4j (UDF)>>
|Aggregating | Consumes many rows and produces an aggregated result            | <<query-functions-user-defined-aggregation, Using aggregating UDF>> | <<java-reference#extending-neo4j-aggregation-functions, Extending Neo4j (Aggregating UDF)>>
