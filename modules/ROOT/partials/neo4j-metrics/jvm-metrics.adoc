.JVM file descriptor metrics.

[options="header",cols="<1m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.file.descriptors.count|The current number of open file descriptors. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.file.descriptors.maximum|(OS setting) The maximum number of open file descriptors. It is recommended to be set to 40K file handles, because of the native and Lucene indexing Neo4j uses. If this metric gets close to the limit, you should consider raising it. (gauge)

.GC metrics.

[options="header",cols="<1m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.gc.time.&lt;gc&gt;|Accumulated garbage collection time in milliseconds. Long GCs can be an indication of performance issues, or potentially instability. If this approaches the heartbeat timeout in a cluster, it may cause unwanted leader switches. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.gc.count.&lt;gc&gt;|Total number of garbage collections. (counter)
|===

.JVM Heap metrics.

[options="header",cols="<1m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.heap.committed|Amount of memory (in bytes) guaranteed to be available for use by the JVM. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.heap.used|Amount of memory (in bytes) currently used. This is the amount of heap space currently used at a given point in time. Monitor this to identify if you are maxing out consistently, in which case, you should increase initial and max heap size, or if you are underutilizing, you should decrease the initial and max heap sizes. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.heap.max|Maximum amount of heap memory (in bytes) that can be used. This is the amount of heap space currently used at a given point in time. Monitor this to identify if you are maxing out consistently, in which case, you should increase initial and max heap size, or if you are underutilizing, you should decrease the initial and max heap sizes. (gauge)

.JVM memory buffers metrics.

[options="header",cols="<1m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.memory.buffer.&lt;bufferpool&gt;.count|Estimated number of buffers in the pool. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.memory.buffer.&lt;bufferpool&gt;.used|Estimated amount of memory used by the pool. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.memory.buffer.&lt;bufferpool&gt;.capacity|Estimated total capacity of buffers in the pool. (gauge)
|===

.JVM memory pools metrics.

[options="header",cols="<1m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|&lt;prefix&gt;.vm.memory.pool.&lt;pool&gt;|Estimated amount of memory in bytes used by the pool. (gauge)
