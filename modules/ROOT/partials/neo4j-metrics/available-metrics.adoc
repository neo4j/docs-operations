.Bolt metrics

[options="header",cols="<1m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.sessions_started|The total number of Bolt sessions created by users since startup. This includes both succeeded and failed sessions (deprecated, use connections_opened instead). Useful for monitoring load via the Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.connections_opened|The total number of Bolt connections opened since startup. This includes both succeeded and failed connections. Useful for monitoring load via the Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.connections_closed|The total number of Bolt connections closed since startup. This includes both properly and abnormally ended connections. Useful for monitoring load via Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.connections_running|The total number of Bolt connections that are currently executing Cypher and returning results. Useful to track the overall load on Bolt connections. This is limited to the number of Bolt worker threads that have been configured via `dbms.connector.bolt.thread_pool_max_size`. Reaching this maximum indicated the server is running at capacity. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.connections_idle|The total number of Bolt connections that are not currently executing Cypher or returning results. (gauge)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.messages_received|The total number of messages received via Bolt since startup. Useful to track general message activity in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.messages_started|The total number of messages that have started processing since being received. A received message may have begun processing until a Bolt worker thread becomes available. A large gap being observed between between `bolt.messages_received` and `bolt.messages_started` could indicate the server is running at capacity. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.messages_done|The total number of Bolt messages that have completed processing whether successfully or unsuccessfully. Useful for tracking overall load. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.messages_failed|The total number of messages that have failed while processing. A high number of failures may indicate an issue with server and further investigation of the logs is recommended. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.accumulated_queue_time|(unsupported feature) When `internal.server.bolt.thread_pool_queue_size` is enabled,  the total time in milliseconds that a Bolt message waits in the processing queue before a Bolt worker thread becomes available to process it. Sharp increases in this value indicate that server is running at capacity. If `internal.server.bolt.thread_pool_queue_size` is disabled, the value should be `0`, meaning that messages are directly handed off to worker threads. (counter)
|&lt;prefix&gt;.bolt.accumulated_processing_time|The total amount of time in milliseconds that worker threads have been processing messages. Useful for monitoring load via Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|===

|&lt;prefix&gt;.check_point.duration|The duration, in milliseconds, of the last check point event. Checkpoints should generally take several seconds to several minutes. Long checkpoints can be an issue, as these are invoked when the database stops, when a hot backup is taken, and periodically as well. Values over `30` minutes or so should be cause for some investigation. (gauge) 
|===
