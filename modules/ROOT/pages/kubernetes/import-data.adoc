== Importing data into Neo4j on Kubernetes

The Neo4j Helm chart configures a volume mount at _/import_ as the Neo4j _import_ directory, as described in xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc[].
You place all the files that you want to import in this volume.

// There is a wide range of ways to import data from files into a Neo4j instance.
// Possible data sources include:
//
// * Structured text file(s), such as CSV.
// //* Other supported data file(s), such as JSON, XLS, GraphML, etc.

To import data from CSV files into Neo4j, use the command `neo4j-admin import` or the Cypher query `LOAD CSV`.

* The xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc[`neo4j-admin import`] command can be used to do batch imports of large amounts of data into a previously unused database and can only be performed once per database.
* `LOAD CSV` Cypher statement can be used to import small to medium-sized CSV files into an existing database.
`LOAD CSV` can be run as many times as needed and does not require an empty database.
For a simple example, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/cypher-intro/load-csv[Getting Started Guide -> Import data].

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your Neo4j configuration, some methods support fetching data to import from a remote location (e.g., using HTTP or fetching from cloud object storage).
Therefore, it is not always necessary to place the source data files in the Neo4j _import_ directory.
====

[[configure-import]]
== Configure the import volume mount

The default configuration of the `/import` volume mount is to share the `/data` volume mount.
Generally, this is sufficient, and it is unnecessary to explicitly configure an _import_ volume in the Helm deployment's _values.yaml_ file.
For the full details of configuring volume mounts for a Neo4j Helm deployment, see xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc#volume-mounts[Volume mounts and persistent volumes].

This example shows how to configure `/import` to use a dynamically provisioned Persistent Volume of the default `StorageClass`:

[source, properties]
----
volumes:
  import:
    mode: "defaultStorageClass"
    defaultStorageClass:
      requests:
        storage: 100Gi
----

[[copy-files]]
== Copy files to the _import_ volume using `kubectl cp`

Files can be copied to the _import_ volume using `kubectl cp`.
This example shows how to copy a local directory `my-files/` to `/import/files-1` to a Neo4j instance with the release name `my-graph-db` in the namespace `default`.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl cp my-files/ default/my-graph-db-0:/import/files-1

# Validate: list the contents of /import/files-1
kubectl exec my-graph-db-0 -- ls /import/files-1
----

Instead of using `kubectl cp`, data can also be loaded onto the `/import` directory by:

* using an additional container or `initContainer` to load data.
* using `kubectl exec` to run commands to load data.
* mounting a volume that is already populated with data.

[NOTE]
====
Data must be placed in the volume's `/import` directory.
====

[[use-neo4j-admin-import]]
== Use `neo4j-admin import`

The simplest way to run `neo4j-admin import` is to use `kubectl exec` to run it in the Neo4j container.
However, running `neo4j-admin import` to perform a large import in the same container as the Neo4j process may cause resource contention problems, including causing either or both processes to be OOM Killed by the node operating system.
To avoid this, either use a separate container or `initContainer` or place the Neo4j Helm deployment in xref:kubernetes/maintenance.adoc#offline-maintenance[offline maintenance mode] to run `neo4j-admin import`.

`neo4j-admin import` cannot be used to replace an existing database while Neo4j is running.
To replace an existing database, either `DROP` the database or put the Neo4j Helm deployment into offline maintenance mode before running `neo4j-admin import`.

[[alternative-import]]
== Alternative approach

An alternative approach to importing data into Neo4j is to run a separate Neo4j standalone instance outside Kubernetes, perform the import on that Neo4j instance, and then copy the resulting database into the Kubernetes-based Neo4j instance using the xref:kubernetes/maintenance.adoc#kubernetes-neo4j-backup-restore[backup and restore] or xref:kubernetes/maintenance.adoc#kubernetes-neo4j-dump[dump and load] procedures.
