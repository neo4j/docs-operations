= Maintenance modes

Neo4j supports two maintenance modes: online and offline, which you can use to perform different maintenance tasks.

[[online-maintenance]]
== Online Maintenance

Online maintenance does not require stopping the `neo4j` process.
It is performed using the command `kubectl exec`.

To directly run tasks:

[source, shell]
----
kubectl exec <release-name>-0 -- neo4j-admin store-info --all /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases --expand-commands
----

[NOTE]
====
All `neo4j-admin` commands need the `--expand-commands` flag to run in the Neo4j container.
This is because the Neo4j Helm chart defines the Neo4j configuration using command expansion to dynamically resolve some configuration parameters at runtime.
====

To run a series of commands, use an interactive shell:

[source, shell]
----
kubectl exec -it <release-name>-0 -- bash
----

[NOTE]
====
Processes executed using `kubectl exec` count towards the Neo4j containerâ€™s memory allocation.
Therefore, running tasks that use a significant amount of memory or running Neo4j in an extremely memory-constrained configuration could cause the Neo4j container to be terminated by the underlying Operating System.
====

[[offline-maintenance]]
== Offline Maintenance

You use the Neo4j offline maintenance mode to perform maintenance tasks that require Neo4j to be offline.
In this mode, the `neo4j` process is not running.
However, the Neo4j Pod does run, but it never reaches the status `READY`.

[[put-offline-mode]]
=== Put the Neo4j instance in offline mode

. To put the Neo4j instance in offline maintenance mode, you set the `offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled: true` and upgrade the helm release.

* You can do that by using the _values.yaml_ file:
.. Open your _values.yaml_ file and add `offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled: true` to the `neo4j` object:
+
[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
 offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled: true
----
+
.. Run `helm upgrade` to apply the changes:
+
[source, shell]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone -f values.yaml
----
* Alternatively, you can set `neo4j.offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled` to `true` as part of the `helm upgrade` command:
+
[source, shell]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone --version={neo4j-version-exact} --set neo4j.offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled=true
----

. Poll `kubectl get pods` until the pod has restarted (`STATUS`=`Running`).
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl get pod <release-name>-0
----
+
. Connect to the pod with an interactive shell:
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl exec -it "<release-name>-0" -- bash
----
+
. View running java processes:
+
[source, shell]
----
jps
----
+
[queryresult]
----
19 Jps
----
+
The result shows no running java process other than `jps` itself.

[[offline-run-tasks]]
=== Run task in offline mode

Offline maintenance tasks are performed using the command `kubectl exec`.

* To directly run tasks:
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl exec <release-name>-0 -- neo4j-admin store-info --all /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases --expand-commands
----

* To run a series of commands, use an interactive shell:
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl exec -it <release-name>-0 -- bash
----

* For long-running commands, use a shell and run tasks using `nohup` so they continue if the `kubectl exec` connection is lost:
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl exec -it <release-name>-0 -- bash
  $ nohup neo4j-admin check-consistency --database=neo4j --expand-commands &>job.out </dev/null &
  $ tail -f job.out
----

[[put-online-mode]]
=== Put the Neo4j DBMS in online mode

When you finish with the maintenance tasks, return the Neo4j instance to normal operation:

* You can do that by using the _values.yaml_ file:
. Open your _values.yaml_ file and add `offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled: false` to the `neo4j` object:
+
[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
 offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled: false
----
+
. Run `helm upgrade` to apply the changes:
+
[source, shell]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone -f values.yaml
----

* Alternatively, you can run `helm upgrade` with the flag set to `false`:
+
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone --version={neo4j-version-exact} --set neo4j.offlineMaintenanceModeEnabled=false
----
