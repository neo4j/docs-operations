== Prepare to back up a database(s) to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) bucket

You can perform a backup of a Neo4j database(s) to any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) bucket using the _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart.
From Neo4j 5.10, the _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart also supports performing a backup of multiple databases.
From 5.13, the _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart also supports workload identity integration for GCP, AWS, and Azure.
From 5.14, the _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart also supports MinIO (an AWS S3-compatible object storage API) for Non-TLS/SSL endpoints.

=== Prerequisites

Before you can back up a database and upload it to your bucket, verify that you have the following:

* A cloud provider bucket (AWS, GCP, or Azure) with read and write access to be able to upload the backup.
* Credentials to access the cloud provider bucket, such as a service account JSON key file for GCP, a credentials file for AWS, or storage account credentials for Azure.
* A service account with workload identity if you want to use workload identity integration to access the cloud provider bucket.
** For more information on setting up a service account with workload identity on GCP and AWS, see:
*** link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) -> Use Workload Identity]
*** link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html[Amazon EKS -> Configuring a Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role]
** For more information on setting up an Azure storage account with workload identity, link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=go[Microsoft Azure -> Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)]
* A Kubernetes cluster running on one of the cloud providers with the Neo4j Helm chart installed.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/quickstart-standalone/index.adoc[Quickstart: Deploy a standalone instance] or xref:kubernetes/quickstart-cluster/index.adoc[Quickstart: Deploy a cluster].
* MinIO server (an AWS S3-compatible object storage API) if you want to push your backups to a MinIO bucket.
For more information, see link:https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/integrations/aws-cli-with-minio.html[MinIO official documentation].
* The latest Neo4j Helm charts.
You can update the repository to get the latest charts using `helm repo update`.

=== Create a Kubernetes secret

You can create a Kubernetes secret with the credentials that can access the cloud provider bucket using one of the following options:

[.tabbed-example]
=====
[.include-with-gke]
======
Create the secret named `gcpcreds` using your GCP service account JSON key file.
The JSON key file contains all the details of the service account that has access to the bucket.

[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
kubectl create secret generic gcpcreds --from-file=credentials=/path/to/gcpcreds.json
----
======

[.include-with-aws]
======
. Create a credentials file in the following format:
+
[source, properties, role='noheader']
----
[ default ]
region = us-east-1
aws_access_key_id = <your-aws_access_key_id>
aws_secret_access_key = <your-aws_secret_access_key>
----
. Create the secret named `awscreds` via the credentials file:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
kubectl create secret generic awscreds --from-file=credentials=/path/to/your/credentials
----
======

[.include-with-azure]
======
. Create a credentials file in the following format:
+
[source, properties, role='noheader']
----
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your-azure-storage-account-name>
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<your-azure-storage-account-key>
----
. Create the secret named `azurecred` via the credentials file:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
kubectl create secret generic azurecred --from-file=credentials=/path/to/your/credentials
----
======
=====

=== Configure the backup parameters

You can configure the backup parameters in the _backup-values.yaml_ file either by using the `secretName` and `secretKeyName` parameters or by mapping the Kubernetes service account
to the workload identity integration.

[NOTE]
====
The following examples show the minimum configuration required to perform a backup to a cloud provider bucket.
For more information about the available backup parameters, see <<kubernetes-neo4j-backup-parameters, Backup parameters>>.
====

==== Configure the _backup-values.yaml_ file using the `secretName` and `secretKeyName` parameters

==== Configure the _backup-values.yaml_ file using service account workload identity integration

In certain situations, it may be useful to assign a Kubernetes Service Account with workload identity integration to the Neo4j backup pod.
This is particularly relevant when you want to improve security and have more precise access control for the pod.
Doing so ensures that secure access to resources is granted based on the pod's identity within the cloud ecosystem.
For more information on setting up a service account with workload identity, see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) -> Use Workload Identity], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html[Amazon EKS -> Configuring a Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role], and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=go[Microsoft Azure -> Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)].

To configure the Neo4j backup pod to use a Kubernetes service account with workload identity, set `serviceAccountName` to the name of the service account to use.
For Azure deployments, you also need to set the `azureStorageAccountName` parameter to the name of the Azure storage account, where the backup files will be uploaded.
For example:

=====
The _/backups_ mount created by default is an _emptyDir_ type volume.
This means that the data stored in this volume is not persistent and will be lost when the pod is deleted.
To use a persistent volume for backups add the following section to the _backup-values.yaml_ file:

[source, yaml, role='noheader']
----
tempVolume:
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: backup-pvc
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to create the persistent volume and persistent volume claim before installing the _neo4j-admin_ Helm chart.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc[Volume mounts and persistent volumes].
====

==== Configure the _backup-values.yaml_ file for using MinIO

_This feature is available from Neo4j 5.14._

MinIO is an AWS S3-compatible object storage API.
You can specify the `minioEndpoint` parameter in the _backup-values.yaml_ file to push your backups to your MinIO bucket.
This endpoint must be a s3 API endpoint or else the backup Helm chart will fail.
Only non-TLS/SSL endpoints are supported.
For example:

[source, yaml, role='noheader']
----
neo4j:
  image: "neo4j/helm-charts-backup"

== Prepare to back up a database(s) to on-premises storage

_This feature is available from Neo4j 5.16._

You can perform a backup of a Neo4j database(s) to on-premises storage using the _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart.
When configuring the _backup-values.yaml_ file, keep the “cloudProvider” field empty and provide a persistent volume in the `tempVolume` section to ensure the backup files are persistent if the pod is deleted.

[NOTE]
====
You need to create the persistent volume and persistent volume claim before installing the _neo4j-admin_ Helm chart.

[[kubernetes-neo4j-backup-parameters]]
== Backup parameters

To see what options are configurable on the Helm chart use `helm show values` and the Helm chart _neo4j/neo4j-admin_. +
From Neo4j 5.10, the _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart also supports assigning your Neo4j pods to specific nodes using `nodeSelector` labels, and from Neo4j 5.11, using affinity/anti-affinity rules or tolerations.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/operations/assign-neo4j-pods.adoc[Assigning backup pods to specific nodes] and the Kubernetes official documentation on link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity[Affinity and anti-affinity] rules and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[Taints and Tolerations].

== Back up your database(s)

To back up your database(s), you install the _neo4j-admin_ Helm chart using the configured _backup-values.yaml_ file.

. Install _neo4j-admin_ Helm chart using the _backup-values.yaml_ file:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
helm install backup-name neo4j-admin -f /path/to/your/backup-values.yaml
----
+
The _neo4j/neo4j-admin_ Helm chart installs a cronjob that launches a pod based on the job schedule.
This pod performs a backup of one or multiple databases, a consistency check of the backup file(s),  and uploads them to the cloud provider bucket.

. Monitor the backup pod logs using `kubectl logs pod/<neo4j-backup-pod-name>` to check the progress of the backup.
. Check that the backup files and the consistency check reports have been uploaded to the cloud provider bucket or on-premises storage.

[role=label--new-5.21]
[[kubernetes-neo4j-backup-aggregate]]
== Aggregate a database backup chain

The aggregate backup command turns a backup chain into a single backup file.
This is useful when you have a backup chain that you want to restore to a different cluster, or when you want to archive a backup chain.
For more information on the benefits of the aggregate backup chain operation, its syntax and available options, see xref:backup-restore/aggregate.adoc[Aggregate a database backup chain].

[NOTE]
====
The neo4j-admin Helm chart supports aggregating a backup chain stored in an AWS S3 bucket or a local mount.
If enabled, normal backup will not be done, only aggregate backup.
====

. To aggregate a backup chain stored in an AWS S3 bucket or a local mount, you need to provide the following information in your _backup-values.yaml_ file:
+
[.tabbed-example]
=====
[.include-with-aws]
======

If your backup chain is stored on AWS S3, you need to set cloudProvider to `aws` and use either `creds` or `serviceAccount` to connect to your AWS S3 bucket.
For example:

.Connect to your AWS S3 bucket using the `awscreds` secret

. Install the _neo4j-admin_ Helm chart using the configured _backup-values.yaml_ file:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
helm install backup-name neo4j-admin -f /path/to/your/backup-values.yaml

. Monitor the pod logs using `kubectl logs pod/<neo4j-aggregate-backup-pod-name>` to check the progress of the aggregate backup operation.
. Verify that the aggregated backup file has replaced your backup chain in the cloud provider bucket or on-premises storage.

== Restore a single database

To restore a single offline database or a database backup, you first need to delete the database that you want to replace unless you want to restore the backup as an additional database in your DBMS.
Then, use the restore command of `neo4j-admin` to restore the database backup.
Finally, use the Cypher command `CREATE DATABASE name` to create the restored database in the `system` database.

=== Delete the database that you want to replace

Before you restore the database backup, you have to delete the database that you want to replace with that backup using the Cypher command `DROP DATABASE name` against the `system` database.
If you want to restore the backup as an additional database in your DBMS, then you can proceed to the next section.

[NOTE]
====
For Neo4j cluster deployments, you run the Cypher command `DROP DATABASE name` only on one of the cluster servers.
The command is automatically routed from there to the other cluster members.
====
. Connect to the Neo4j DBMS:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
kubectl exec -it <release-name>-0 -- bash
----
+
. Connect to the `system` database using `cypher-shell`:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <password> -d system
----
+
. Drop the database you want to replace with the backup:
+
[source, cypher, role='noheader']
----
DROP DATABASE neo4j;
----
. Exit the Cypher Shell command-line console:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
:exit;
----

=== Restore the database backup

You use the `neo4j-admin database restore` command to restore the database backup, and then the Cypher command `CREATE DATABASE name` to create the restored database in the `system` database.
For information about the command syntax, options, and usage, see xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc[Restore a database backup].

[NOTE]
====
For Neo4j cluster deployments, restore the database backup on each cluster server.
====
. Run the `neo4j-admin database restore` command to restore the database backup:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
neo4j-admin database restore neo4j --from-path=/backups/neo4j --expand-commands
----
+
. Connect to the `system` database using `cypher-shell`:
+
[source, shell, role='noheader']
----
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <password> -d system
----
+
. Create the `neo4j` database.
+
[NOTE]
====
For Neo4j cluster deployments, you run the Cypher command `CREATE DATABASE name` only on one of the cluster servers.
====
+
[source, cypher, role='noheader']
----
CREATE DATABASE neo4j;
----
. Open the browser at _http://<external-ip>:7474/browser/_ and check that all data has been successfully restored.
. Execute a Cypher command against the `neo4j` database, for example:
+
[source, cypher, role='noheader']
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have backed up your database with the option `--include-metadata`, you can manually restore the users and roles metadata.
For more information, see xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc#restore-backup-example[Restore a database backup -> Example].
====

[NOTE]
====
To restore the `system` database, follow the steps described in xref:kubernetes/operations/dump-load.adoc[Dump and load databases (offline)].
