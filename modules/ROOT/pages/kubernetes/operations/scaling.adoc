[[scaling]]
= Scale a Neo4j deployment

Neo4j supports both vertical and horizontal scaling.

[[vertical-scaling]]
== Vertical scaling

To increase or decrease the resources (CPU, memory) available to a Neo4j instance, change the `neo4j.resources` object in the _values.yaml_ file to set the desired resource usage, and then perform a helm upgrade.

[NOTE]
====
If you change the memory allocated to the Neo4j container, you should also change the Neo4j's memory configuration (`dbms.memory.heap.max_size` and `dbms.memory.pagecache.size` in particular).
See xref:configure-resources[Configure Resource Allocation] for more details.
====

For example, if your running Neo4j instance has the following allocated resources:

[source, role=noheader]
----
# values.yaml
neo4j:
  resources:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "3Gi"
# Neo4j Configuration (yaml format)
config:
  dbms.memory.heap.initial_size: "2G"
  dbms.memory.heap.max_size: "2G"
  dbms.memory.pagecache.size: "500m"
----

And, you want to increase them to 2 CPUs and 4 GB of memory (allocating additional memory to the pagecache).

. Modify the _values.yaml_ file to set the desired resource usage:
+
[source, yaml]
----
# values.yaml
neo4j:
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "4Gi"
# Neo4j Configuration (yaml format)
config:
  dbms.memory.heap.initial_size: "2G"
  dbms.memory.heap.max_size: "2G"
  dbms.memory.pagecache.size: "1G"
----
+
. Run `helm upgrade` with the modified deployment _values.yaml_ file and the respective Helm chart (_neo4j/neo4j-standalone_, _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-core_, or _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-read-replica)_ to apply the changes.
For example:
+
[source, shell]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone -f values.yaml
----

[role=enterprise-edition]
[[horizontal-scaling]]
== Horizontal scaling

You can add a new core member or a read replica to the Neo4j cluster to scale out write or read workloads.

. In the Kubernetes cluster, verify that you have a node that you can use for the new Neo4j cluster member.
. Create a persistent disk for the new Neo4j cluster member to be used for its `data` volume mount.
For more information, see and xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc[Volume mounts and persistent volumes].
. Create a Helm deployment YAML file for the new Neo4j cluster member with all the configuration settings and the disk you have created for it.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/quickstart-cluster/create-value-file.adoc[Create Helm deployment values files] and xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc[Configure a Neo4j Helm deployment].
. Install the new member using the command `helm install`, the deployment _values.yaml_ file, and the respective Helm chart (_neo4j/neo4j-cluster-core_ or _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-read-replica)_.
For example:
+
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
helm install rr-2 neo4j/neo4j-cluster-read-replica -f rr-2.values.yaml
----
