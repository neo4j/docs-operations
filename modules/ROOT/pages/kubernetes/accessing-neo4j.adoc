:description: This section describes how to access a Neo4j DBMS running on Kubernetes. 

A Neo4j DBMS is accessible via Kubernetes Services.
Neo4j has a number of different interfaces for different application and operational purposes.
For more details, see xref:configuration/ports.adoc[Neo4j ports].

[[k8s-services]]
== Supported Kubernetes services

The Neo4j Helm chart publishes three K8s services:

* *Neo4j Service* -- a ClusterIP service for application `neo4j`/`bolt` and `http(s)` connections to the Neo4j database, originating from inside the Kubernetes cluster.
* *Admin Service* -- a “Headless” (DNS only) service that includes all Neo4j ports.
It is only available inside the Kubernetes cluster and access to it should be guarded.
The Admin service can be used for Neo4j DBMS administration, performing backups, and collecting metrics.
* *External* -- a LoadBalancer service for application `neo4j`/`bolt` and `http(s)` connections originating from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

*The Admin service bypasses health checks.
This allows it to be used to make connections for administrative purposes when the database is in an unhealthy state.
However, you must not use it to connect from applications that require the database to be in a healthy state.

[[access-inside-k8s]]
== Applications accessing Neo4j from inside Kubernetes

[[access-inside-k8s-dns]]
=== Access Neo4j using DNS
To access Neo4j from an application in the same Kubernetes cluster use the Neo4j service DNS address `<release-name>.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>`.

The default cluster domain is `cluster.local` and the default namespace is `default`.
Generally, the Neo4j service DNS address is _<release-name>.default.svc.cluster.local_.

For example, if using the release name `my-release` in the `default` namespace, the cluster's DNS address would be `my-release.default.svc.cluster.local`, and the `bolt` address for use with Neo4j drivers would be _neo4j://my-release.default.svc.cluster.local:7687_.

[[access-inside-k8s-label]]
=== Access Neo4j using K8s label selector

Alternatively, the Neo4j service in Kubernetes can be located using Kubernetes service discovery by searching with the label selector:
`helm.neo4j.com/service=neo4j,helm.neo4j.com/instance=<release-name>`.

For example:

[source,shell]
----
# install neo4j
helm install "my-release" …
# lookup installed service
kubectl get service -l helm.neo4j.com/service=neo4j,helm.neo4j.com/instance=my-release
----

[[ad-hoc-access]]
=== Ad-hoc external access using `kubectl port-forward`

In most cases, it is possible to access the Neo4j service from a developer machine outside the Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl port-forward`.
To access the Neo4j service for `http(s)` and `neo4j/bolt` from a developer machine, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl port-forward svc/<release-name> tcp-bolt tcp-http tcp-https
----

Neo4j is accessible via the Neo4j browser at http://localhost:7474.

[[access-outside-k8s]]
== Applications accessing Neo4j from outside Kubernetes

To access Neo4j from an application outside the Kubernetes cluster, use the IP address of the external service.
The external IP(s) of the `LoadBalancer` can be found using `kubectl`:

* Using with the service name `<release-name>-external`:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get service <release-name>-external -ocustom-columns=ip:.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip
----

* Using a label selector:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get service -l helm.neo4j.com/service=external,helm.neo4j.com/name=<release-name> -ocustom-columns=ip:.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip
----

If the Kubernetes `LoadBalancer` implementation that you are using supports setting a static IP, the IP address of the `LoadBalancer` can be configured in the Neo4j Helm release by setting `externalService.loadBalancerIP`.
If a static IP address is not explicitly set, then Kubernetes does not guarantee that a dynamically assigned IP address will not change.

When exposing a Neo4j database on the Internet, it is recommended to use a static IP and configure SSL on the exposed services.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#configure-ssl[Configure SSL].

If you have static IPs, you can associate DNS with them and obtain trusted certificates.

The ports that are exposed on the external service can be configured in the Helm release by changing the `externalService` object.
The default values are:

[source, yaml]
----
externalService:
 annotations: { }
 loadBalancerIP: NULL

 ports:
   http:
     enabled: true
   https:
     enabled: true
   bolt:
     enabled: true
   backup:
     enabled: false
----

Disabling / enabling a port on the `externalService` object removes it from the load balancer but does not affect whether it is disabled/enabled in Neo4j.

[NOTE]
====
Backup is not secure unless SSL-with-client-auth is enforced in the Neo4j configuration.

[[custom-k8s-resources]]
== Customizing Kubernetes Resources

The Neo4j Helm chart creates various Kubernetes resources.
Some of them can be customized by adding extra configuration to the helm deployment values file.

[[access-dbms-admin]]
== Accessing Neo4j for DBMS administration and monitoring
The Neo4j Helm chart creates the admin service for the purposes of Neo4j administration.
The admin service is a “Headless” service in Kubernetes and does not depend on Neo4j health checks.
Therefore, it permits connections to Neo4j even if Neo4j is not healthy.
In general, that is not desirable for applications but can be useful for administration and debugging.

[[access-dbms-admin-dns]]
=== Access Neo4j using DNS
To access the admin service inside Kubernetes use the DNS address _<release-name>-admin.<namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>_.

For example, if using the release name `my-release` in the `default` namespace, the cluster's DNS address would be `my-release-admin.default.svc.cluster.local`.

The admin service can be used to access a range of Neo4j interfaces:

* Neo4j Bolt for Neo4j administration via Cypher commands
* Neo4j Backup for taking database backups
* Graphite for metrics collection
* Prometheus for metrics collection
* Java Management Extensions (JMX) for metrics collection and JVM administration

[[access-dbms-admin-kubectl]]
=== Access Neo4j using `kubectl` for troubleshooting

To get an interactive `cypher-shell` console for troubleshooting, use this command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl run -it --rm --image neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact} cypher-shell -- cypher-shell -a bolt://my-release-admin.default.svc.cluster.local
----

Generally, the `neo4j://` protocol is used for connecting to Neo4j.
For troubleshooting, though, the direct `bolt://` protocol is used because it allows a connection in some situations where a `neo4j://` connection will not succeed.
