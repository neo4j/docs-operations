:description: This section describes how to see what is happening with Neo4j running on Kubernetes. 

[[monitoring-logging]]
== Logging

When using the Helm Chart, Neo4j logging output is written to files in the `/logs` directory.
This directory is mounted on a `PersistentVolume` so that logs are persisted if the pod is moved or restarted.
For full details of Neo4j logging, see xref:monitoring/logging.adoc[Neo4j logging].

* To view the Neo4j user log (_neo4j.log_), use the command `kubectl exec`:
+
.Follow _neo4j.log_
[source,shell]
----
kubectl exec <neo4j-pod-name> -- tail -f /logs/neo4j.log
----

* To copy the log files from a Neo4j instance, use `kubectl cp`:
+
.Copy all logs
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]]
----
$ kubectl cp <neo4j-pod-name>:/logs neo4j-logs/
$ ls neo4j-logs
debug.log       neo4j.log       query.log       security.log
----

[[log-collection]]
== Log collection

The Neo4j log output can be collected from the log files and sent to a unified location using tools, such as Fluentd (https://www.fluentd.org) or Logstash (https://www.elastic.co/logstash).
We recommend running these either as "sidecar" containers in the Neo4j pods or as separate DaemonSets.

* For more information about Pods and the sidecar pattern, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/[Kubernetes Pod documentation].
* For more information about DaemonSets, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[Kubernetes DaemonSet documentation].
* For more information and examples of these logging patterns, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/[Kubernetes cluster administration documentation].


[[monitoring-metrics]]
== Metrics

If Neo4j is configured to listen for Graphite, JMX, or Prometheus connections for metrics, those services can be accessed as described in xref:kubernetes/accessing-neo4j.adoc[Access a Neo4j Helm release].

The Helm Chart supports standard Neo4j metrics configuration settings, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
# To listen for Prometheus connections
# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  metrics.prometheus.enabled: "true"
  metrics.prometheus.endpoint: "0.0.0.0:2004"
----

[source,yaml]
----
# To publish Graphite connections
# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  metrics.graphite.enabled: "true"
  metrics.graphite.interval: "3s"
  metrics.graphite.server: "graphite.default.svc.cluster.local:2003"
----


[source,yaml]
----
# To write CSV metrics
# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  metrics.csv.enabled: "true"
  metrics.csv.interval: "10s"
----

[source,yaml]
----
# To enable JMX
# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  metrics.jmx.enabled: "true"
----

For more information and examples, see xref:monitoring/metrics/index.adoc[Neo4j metrics].
