[[configure-ldap-password-through-secret]]
== Configure LDAP password through secret

To configure the Neo4j Helm deployment to use the LDAP system password through secret, you need to create a Kubernetes secret with the LDAP password and then add the secret name and the mount path to the _values.yaml_ file.

. Create a secret with the LDAP password by running the following command.
The secret must have a key called `LDAP_PASS`.
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=LDAP_PASS=<ldap-password>
----
. Add the secret name to the _values.yaml_ file.
+
[source, yaml]
----
# ldapPasswordFromSecret defines the secret which holds the password for ldap system account
# Secret key name must be LDAP_PASS
# This secret is accessible by Neo4j at the path defined in ldapPasswordMountPath
ldapPasswordFromSecret: "" #<1>

# The above secret gets mounted to the path mentioned here
ldapPasswordMountPath: "" #<2>
----
<1> -- The secret name as it appears in the Kubernetes cluster.
<2> -- The path where the secret will be mounted as a volume in the Neo4j container.

[[configure-sso]]
== Configure SSO

Neo4j supports SSO authentication and authorization through identity providers implementing the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard.

To configure the Neo4j helm deployment to use SSO authentication, first, you need to configure your identity provider for authentication and authorization using ID tokens.
And then, you configure the Neo4j helm deployment to use that identity provider for authentication by adding all the SSO configurations to the _values.yaml_ file.

For more information on how to configure your identity provider and what settings you should define, see xref:tutorial/tutorial-sso-configuration.adoc[Neo4j Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration].

[IMPORTANT]
====
`sub` is the only claim guaranteed to be unique and stable.
Other claims, such as `email` or `preferred_username`, may change over time and should *not* be used for authentication.
Neo4j may assign permissions to a user based on this username value in a hybrid authorization configuration.
Thus, changing the username claim from `sub` is not recommended.
For details, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens#using-claims-to-reliably-identify-a-user-subject-and-object-id[Microsoft documentation] as well as the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimStability[OpenId spec].

[[k8s-service-accounts]]
== Configure a service account

In some deployment situations, it may be desirable to assign a Kubernetes Service Account to the Neo4j pod.
For example, if processes in the pod want to connect to services that require Service Account authorization.
To configure the Neo4j pod to use a Kubernetes service account, set `podSpec.serviceAccountName` to the name of the service account to use.

For example:

[source, yaml]
----
# neo4j-values.yaml
neo4j:
  password: "my-password"

podSpec:
  serviceAccountName: "neo4j-service-account"
----

[NOTE]
====
The service account must already exist.
In the case of clusters, the Neo4j Helm chart creates and configures the service account.
