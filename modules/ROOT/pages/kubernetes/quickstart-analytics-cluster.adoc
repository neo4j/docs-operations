= Quickstart: Deploy a Neo4j cluster for analytic queries

This quickstart shows how to configure and deploy a special Neo4j cluster that comprises one primary server and N secondary servers to support analytic queries.
The primary server handles the transaction workloads, whereas the secondary servers are configured with the Neo4j Graph Data Science library (GDS) and are used only for the analytic workload. +
Information on using GDS in a cluster can be found in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[Neo4j Graph Data Science library documentation].

The cluster is deployed to a cloud or a local Kubernetes cluster using the Neo4j Helm chart.

== Prerequisites

Before you can deploy a Neo4j cluster on Kubernetes, you need to have:

* A Kubernetes cluster running and the `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.
For more information, see link:xref:kubernetes/quickstart-cluster/prerequisites.adoc[Quickstart: Deploy a cluster -> Prerequisites].
* A valid license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
For more information, see xref:/kubernetes/plugins.adoc#install-gds-ee-bloom[Install GDS Enterprise Edition (EE) and Bloom plugins].
* The xref:kubernetes/helm-charts-setup.adoc[latest version of the Neo4j Helm chart repository].
* (Optional) A valid license for GDS Enterprise Edition.
To install a licensed plugin, you must provide the license files in a Kubernetes secret.
For more information, see xref:/kubernetes/plugins.adoc#install-gds-ee-bloom[Install GDS Enterprise Edition (EE) and Bloom plugins].

== Create a value YAML file for each type of server

To set up a Neo4j cluster for analytic queries, you need to create a value YAML file for each type of server, primary and secondary.
For example:

[.tabbed-example]
=====
[.include-with-primary]
======

Create a value YAML file for the primary server, for example, _primary-value.yaml_:

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  name: analytics-cluster
  acceptLicenseAgreement: "yes"
  edition: enterprise
  password: my-password
volumes:
  data:
    mode: defaultStorageClass

# Disable the Neo4j load balancer and enable the internal service so that the servers can access each other:
services:
  neo4j:
    enabled: false
  internals:
    enabled: true

# Enable the analytics cluster and set the type to primary:
analytics:
  enabled: true
  type:
    name: primary
----
======
[.include-with-secondary]
======
Create a value YAML file for the secondary servers, for example, _secondary-gds.yaml_.
The password must be the same as for the primary server.
If you are using GDS Enterprise Edition, you also need to create a secret with the license file and mount it as the _/licenses_ volume mount.
For more information on how to create a secret, see xref:/kubernetes/plugins.adoc#install-gds-ee-bloom[Install GDS Enterprise Edition (EE) and Bloom plugins].

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  name: analytics-cluster
  acceptLicenseAgreement: "yes"
  edition: enterprise
  password: my-password
volumes:
  data:
    mode: defaultStorageClass
  # Define the volume mount for the license file:
  licenses:
    disableSubPathExpr: true
    mode: volume
    volume:
      secret:
        secretName: gds-license
        items:
          - key: gds.license
            path: gds.license

# Set the environment variables to download the plugins:
env:
  NEO4J_PLUGINS: '["graph-data-science"]'

# Set the configuration for the plugins directory and the mount for the license file:
config:
  gds.enterprise.license_file: "/licenses/gds.license"
  server.directories.plugins: "plugins"

# Disable the Neo4j load balancer and enable the internal service so that the servers can access each other:
services:
  neo4j:
    enabled: false
  internals:
    enabled: true

# Enable the analytics cluster and set the type to secondary:
analytics:
  enabled: true
  type:
    name: secondary

For all available options, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc[Customizing a Neo4j Helm chart].

== Install the servers

. Install a single Neo4j server using the _neo4j-primary.yaml_ file, created in the previous section:
+
[source, bash]
----
helm install primary neo4j/neo4j -f /path/to/neo4j-primary.yaml
----
. Install the first secondary server using the _secondary-gds.yaml_ file, created in the previous section:
+
[source, bash]
----
helm install gds1 neo4j/neo4j -f /path/to/secondary-gds.yaml
----
. Repeat step 2 to deploy a second secondary server.
Use a different name, for example, _gds2_.

== Verify that the GDS library is installed and licensed

. Connect to each of the `gds` pods using the `kubectl exec` command:
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl exec -it gds1-0 -- bash
----
. From the _bin_ folder, connect to the `system` database of the `gds1` server using the `cypher-shell` command:
+
[source, bash]
----
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p my-password -d system -a bolt://gds1-internals.default.svc.cluster.local:7687
----
. Run the following Cypher function to verify that the GDS library is installed:
+
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.version();
----
. Call `gds.isLicensed()` to verify that the GDS library is licensed:
+
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.isLicensed();
----
+
The returned value must be `true`.

== Verify the cluster formation

To verify that the cluster is deployed and running, you can install a load balancer and access Neo4j from the Neo4j Browser.

. Deploy a Neo4j load balancer to the same namespace as the Neo4j cluster:
+
[source, bash]
----
helm install lb neo4j/neo4j-load-balancer --set neo4j.name="analytics-cluster"
----
. When deployed, copy the `EXTERNAL_IP` of the LoadBalancer service.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/quickstart-cluster/access-outside-k8s.adoc[Access the Neo4j cluster from outside Kubernetes].
. In a web browser, open the Neo4j Browser at _http://EXTERNAL_IP:7474/browser_ and log in using the password you have configured in your values YAML files.
. Run the `SHOW SERVERS` command to verify that the cluster is deployed and running.
. Run the `SHOW DATABASES` command to verify that the standalone server is of type `primary` and the GDS servers are of type `secondary`.
