:description: Create a neo4j deployment YAML file.
[role=enterprise-edition]
[[cc-create-value-file]]
= Create Helm deployment values files

You create a Helm deployment YAML file for each Neo4j cluster member with all the configuration settings.

[[cc-config-parameters]]
== Important configuration parameters

`neo4j.name`::
All Neo4j cluster servers are linked together by the value of the parameter `neo4j.name`.
When installed via the Neo4j Helm chart, they will join the cluster identified by `neo4j.name`. +
`neo4j.name` is different from the Helm _release name_, which is used to reference a cluster server elsewhere in Kubernetes. +
All other names and labels of K8s objects created by the Helm chart derive from both `neo4j.name` and _release name_.
The `neo4j.name` parameter is mandatory, and the installation will fail if it is not specified. 
`neo4j.name` must be unique within a namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to install 2 clusters in the same namespace, they must have different values for `neo4j.name`.
====

`neo4j.minimumClusterSize`::
Starting from Neo4j 5.0.0, standalone servers and cluster servers have no distinction.
By default, servers in a cluster can host primary and secondary databases. 
See the xref:clustering/introduction.adoc#clustering-introduction-operational[Operational view] for more details. +
`neo4j.minimumClusterSize` is set to 1 by default, which means the server starts without waiting for the other servers.
When installing a cluster, you should set `neo4j.minimumClusterSize` to the number of desired members in the cluster.
If you later decide to add an extra cluster server in excess of `neo4j.minimumClusterSize`, you need to manually enable it using the Cypher command `ENABLE SERVER`.
For more information on enabling new servers, see xref:clustering/servers.adoc##cluster-add-server[Add a server to the cluster].

`neo4j.resources`::
The size of a Neo4j cluster member is defined by the values of the `neo4j.resources.cpu` and `neo4j.resources.memory` parameters.
The minimum for a Neo4j instance is `0.5` CPU and `2GB` memory.
If invalid or less than the minimum values are provided, Helm will throw an error, for example:
+
[source, role=noheader]
----
Error: template: neo4j/templates/_helpers.tpl:157:11: executing "neo4j.resources.evaluateCPU" at <fail (printf "Provided cpu value %s is less than minimum. \n %s" (.Values.neo4j.resources.cpu) (include "neo4j.resources.invalidCPUMessage" .))>: error calling fail: Provided cpu value 0.25 is less than minimum.
 cpu value cannot be less than 0.5 or 500m
----
+
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#configure-resources[Configure resource allocation].

`neo4j.password`:: 
The password for the `neo4j` user. 
The same password must be set for all cluster members. +
If you do not provide a password, the Neo4j Helm chart will automatically generate one for you.
(Make a note of it.)
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot use `neo4j` as the initial password as this is the default password.
====

`neo4j.edition` and `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement`::
By default, the Neo4j Helm chart installs Neo4j Enterprise Edition since clusters are not available in Community Edition. 
This means that you do not have to explicitly set the configuration parameter `edition:` to `"enterprise"`, as you would do for a standalone server of Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
However, you must acknowledge license compliance by setting `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement` to `"yes"`.
For more information on how to obtain a valid license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition, see https://neo4j.com/licensing/ or write to licensing@neo4j.com.

`volumes.data`::
The `volumes.data` parameter maps the `data` volume mount of each cluster member to the persistent volume for that member.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc[Volume mounts and persistent volumes with the Neo4j Helm chart].

[NOTE]
====
For details of all Neo4j Helm chart configuration options, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc[Configure a Neo4j Helm deployment].

[[servers-values-yaml]]
== Create a values.yaml file for each server

Select the tab as per your Kubernetes environment, and using the provided example, create a YAML file for each of your cluster servers with all the configuration settings.

This guide assumes that the YAML files are named _server-1.values.yaml_, _server-2.values.yaml_ and _server-3.values.yaml_.

The examples use storage classes provided by the vendor.
If you want to use a different type of storage class, such as regional disks, consult the cloud vendor documentation on creating new storage classes.
