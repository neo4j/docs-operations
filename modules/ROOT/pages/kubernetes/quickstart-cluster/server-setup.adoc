= Neo4j Helm Charts for cluster deployments

Neo4j Helm Charts for cluster deployments support more configuration options than for a standalone server. 
To offer the flexibility required to cluster users, the Helm Charts for clusters take a modular approach: the typical cluster deployment requires several Helm Charts installation. 
For example, a cluster with three core nodes requires installing the _neo4j-cluster-core_ chart three times.
By separating the charts up, users can create a different topology of Neo4j and a different topology in their Kubernetes clusters to suit their needs.

The following diagram is a schematic representation of the Helm Charts involved and the Kubernetes and Cloud resources they instantiate when installed:

The diagram shows an example of a Neo4j cluster setup with three cores and one read replica.
The Kubernetes setup includes a headless service for accessing the cluster from inside Kubernetes and a load-balancer service for accessing the cluster from outside Kubernetes. 
Each component is installed using its own Helm Chart.
