= Uninstall Neo4j cluster and clean up resources

[[uninstall-neo4j]]
== Uninstall all Neo4j Helm deployments

. Uninstall each of the cluster members (both the cores and read replica) and the services using their Helm release names:
+
[source, shell]
----
helm uninstall core-1 core-2 core-3 rr-1 lb headless
----
+
[source, result, role=noheader]
----
release "core-1" uninstalled
release "core-2" uninstalled
release "core-3" uninstalled
release "rr-1" uninstalled
release "lb" uninstalled
release "headless" uninstalled
----

[[si-cleanup-resources]]
== Fully remove all the data and resources

Uninstalling the Helm releases does not remove the created resources and data.
Therefore, after uninstalling the helm deployments, you also have to delete all the data and resources.

. Delete all persistent volume claims in the neo4j namespace:
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl delete pvc --all --namespace neo4j
----
. Delete the entire Kubernetes cluster in your cloud provider:
+
