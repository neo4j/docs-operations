:description: This section describes how to configure and install a Neo4j helm deployment in a Kubernetes cluster using a customized Helm chart.
[[kubernetes-neo4j-configuration]]
= Configure a Neo4j Helm deployment


Helm is different from “package managers”, such as `apt`, `yum`, and `npm`, because, in addition to installing applications, Helm allows rich configuration of applications.
The customized configuration should be expressed declaratively in a YAML formatted file, and then passed during installation.

[TIP]
====
For more information, see link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing[Helm official documentation].
====

[[create-yaml]]
== Create a custom _values.yaml_ file

. Ensure your Neo4j Helm chart repository is up to date and get the latest charts.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/helm-charts-setup.adoc[Configure the Neo4j Helm chart repository].
. To see what options are configurable on the Neo4j Helm chart that you want to deploy, use `helm show values` and the Helm chart, such as _neo4j/neo4j-standalone_, _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-core_, _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-read-replica_, _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-headless-service_, and _neo4j/neo4j-cluster-loadbalancer_.
For example:
+
[source, shell]
--
helm show values neo4j/neo4j-standalone
--
+
[source, yaml]

You can amend any of these settings.
Passing that file during installation overrides the default Helm chart configuration of the Neo4j installation on Kubernetes and the configuration of the Neo4j database itself.
+
. Create the _neo4j-values.yaml_ file with your preferred configuration.
For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
# neo4j-values.yaml

neo4j:
  password: "my-password"
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "5Gi"

volumes:
  data:
    mode: "defaultStorageClass"

# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  dbms.default_database: "neo4j"
  dbms.config.strict_validation: "true"
----
+
. Pass the _neo4j-values.yaml_ file during installation.
+
[source, shell]
----
helm install <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone -f neo4j-values.yaml
----
+
[TIP]
====
To see the values that have been set for a given release, use `helm get values <release-name>`.
====

Some examples of possible K8s configurations::
* Configure (or disable completely) the Kubernetes LoadBalancer that exposes Neo4j outside the Kubernetes cluster by modifying the `externalService` object in the _values.yml_ file.
* Set the `securityContext` used by Neo4j Pods by modifying the `securityContext` object in the _values.yml_ file.
* Configure manual persistent volume provisioning or set the `StorageClass` to be used as the Neo4j persistent storage.

Some examples of possible Neo4j configurations::
* All Neo4j configuration (_neo4j.conf_) settings can be set directly on the `config` object in the _values.yaml_ file.
* Neo4j can be configured to use SSL certificates contained in Kubernetes Secrets by modifying the `ssl` object in the values file.

[[configure-neo4j-in-kubernetes]]
== Set Neo4j configuration

The Neo4j Helm chart does not use a `neo4j.conf` file.
Instead, the Neo4j configuration is set in the Helm deployment's _values.yaml_ file under the `config` object.

The `config` object should contain a string map of _neo4j.conf_ setting name to value.
For example, this `config` object configures the Neo4j metrics:

[source, yaml]
----
# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  metrics.enabled: "true"
  metrics.namespaces.enabled: "false"
  metrics.csv.interval: "10s"
  metrics.csv.rotation.keep_number: "2"
  metrics.csv.rotation.compression: "NONE"
----

[NOTE]
====
All Neo4j `config` values must be YAML strings.
It is important to put quotes around the values, such as `"true"`, `"false"`, and `"2"`, so that they are handled correctly as strings.
====

All _neo4j.conf_ settings are supported except for `dbms.jvm.additional`.
Additional JVM settings can be set on the `jvm` object in the Helm deployment _values.yaml_ file, as shown in the example:

[source, java]
----
# Jvm configuration for Neo4j
jvm:
  additionalJvmArguments:
  - "-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError"
  - "-XX:HeapDumpPath=/logs/neo4j.hprof"
----

To find out more about configuring Neo4j and the _neo4j.conf_ file, see xref:configuration/index.adoc[Configuration] and xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[The neo4j.conf file].

[[set-initial-password]]
== Set an initial password

You can set an initial password for accessing Neo4j in the _values.yaml_ file.
If no initial password is set, the Neo4j Helm chart will automatically generate one.
In cluster deployments, the same password must be set for all cluster members.

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
 # If not set or empty a random password will be generated
 password: ""
----

The password will be printed out in the Helm install output, unless `--set logInitialPassword=false` is used.

The initial Neo4j password is stored in a _Kubernetes Secret_.
The password can be extracted from the _Secret_ using this command:

[source, shell]
----
kubectl get secret <release-name>-auth -oyaml | yq -r '.data.NEO4J_AUTH' | base64 -d
----

[TIP]
====
To change the initial password, follow the steps in xref:kubernetes/operations/reset-password.adoc[Reset the Neo4j user password].

Once you change the password in Neo4j, the password stored in _Kubernetes Secrets_ will still exist but will no longer be valid.
====

[[configure-ssl]]
== Configure SSL

The Neo4j xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc[SSL Framework] can be used with Neo4j Helm charts.
You can specify SSL policy objects for `bolt`, `https`, `cluster`, `backup`, and `fabric`.
SSL public certificates and private keys to use with a Neo4j Helm deployment must be stored in _Kubernetes Secrets_.

To enable Neo4j SSL policies, configure the `ssl.<policy name>` object in the Neo4j Helm deployment's _values.yaml_ file to reference the _Kubernetes Secrets_ containing the SSL certificates and keys to use.
This example shows how to configure the `bolt` SSL policy:

[source, yaml]
----
ssl:
 bolt:
   privateKey:
     secretName: bolt-cert
     subPath: private.key
   publicCertificate:
     secretName: bolt-cert
     subPath: public.crt
----

When a private key is specified in the _values.yaml_ file, the Neo4j `ssl` policy is enabled automatically.
To disable a policy, add `dbms.ssl.policy.{{ $name }}.enabled: "false"` to the `config` object.

[NOTE]
====
Unencrypted `http` is not disabled automatically when `https` is enabled.
If `https` is enabled, add `dbms.connector.http.enabled: "false"` to the `config` object to disable `http`.
====

For more information on configuring SSL policies, see xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc[SSL Framework configuration].

The following examples show how to deploy a Neo4j cluster with configured SSL policies.

[[configure-ssl-with-self-signed-certificates]]

=== Create a self-signed certificate

If you do not have a self-signed certificate to use, follow the steps to create one:

. Create a new folder for the self-signed certificate.
This example uses the _/neo4j-ssl_ folder.
+
[source, shell]
----
mkdir neo4j-ssl
cd neo4j-ssl
----
. Create the `private.key` and `public.crt` for the self-signed certificate by using the `openssl` command and passing all the values in the `subj` argument:
+

[[configure-sso]]
== Configure SSO

Neo4j supports SSO authentication and authorization through identity providers implementing the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard.

To configure the Neo4j helm deployment to use SSO authentication, first, you need to configure your identity provider for authentication and authorization using ID tokens.
And then, you configure the Neo4j helm deployment to use that identity provider for authentication by adding all the SSO configurations to the _values.yaml_ file.

For more information on how to configure your identity provider and what settings you should define, see xref:tutorial/tutorial-sso-configuration.adoc[Neo4j Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration].

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
`sub` is the only claim guaranteed to be unique and stable.
Other claims, such as `email` or `preferred_username`, may change over time and should *not* be used for authentication.
Neo4j may assign permissions to a user based on this username value in a hybrid authorization configuration.
Thus, changing the username claim from `sub` is not recommended.
For details, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens[Microsoft documentation] as well as the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimStability[OpenId spec].

[[configure-ldap-password-through-secret]]
== Configure LDAP password through secret
label:enterprise-edition[]

To configure the Neo4j Helm deployment to use the LDAP system password through secret, you need to create a Kubernetes secret with the LDAP password and then add the secret name and the mount path to the _values.yaml_ file.

. Create a secret with the LDAP password by running the following command.
The secret must have a key called `LDAP_PASS`.
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=LDAP_PASS=<ldap-password>
----
. Add the secret name to the _values.yaml_ file.
+
[source, yaml]
----
# ldapPasswordFromSecret defines the secret which holds the password for ldap system account
# Secret key name must be LDAP_PASS
# This secret is accessible by Neo4j at the path defined in ldapPasswordMountPath
ldapPasswordFromSecret: "" #<1>
# The above secret gets mounted to the path mentioned here
ldapPasswordMountPath: "" #<2>
----
<1> -- The secret name as it appears in the Kubernetes cluster.
<2> -- The path where the secret will be mounted as a volume in the Neo4j container.


[[configure-resources]]
== Configure resource allocation

*CPU and memory*::
The resources (CPU, memory) for the Neo4j container are configured by setting `neo4j.resources` object in the _values.yaml_ file.
In the resource _requests_, you can specify how much CPU and memory the Neo4j container needs, while in the resource _limits_, you can set a limit on these resources in case the container tries to use more resources than its _requests_ allow.
//For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[the Kubernetes container resources documentation].
+
[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  resources:
    requests:
     cpu: "1000m"
     memory: "2Gi"
    limits:
     cpu: "2000m"
     memory: "4Gi"
----
+
If no resource _requests_ and resource _limits_ are specified, the values set in the `resources` object are used for both the Neo4j container's resource _requests_ and resource _limits_.
+
[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "5Gi"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The minimum for a Neo4j instance is `0.5` CPU and `2GB` memory. +
If invalid or less than the minimum values are provided, Helm will throw an error, for example:

[source, role=noheader]
----
Error: template: neo4j-standalone/templates/_helpers.tpl:157:11: executing "neo4j.resources.evaluateCPU" at <fail (printf "Provided cpu value %s is less than minimum. \n %s" (.Values.neo4j.resources.cpu) (include "neo4j.resources.invalidCPUMessage" .))>: error calling fail: Provided cpu value 0.25 is less than minimum.
 cpu value cannot be less than 0.5 or 500m
----
====

*JVM heap and page cache*::
You configure Neo4j to use the memory provided to the container by setting the parameters `dbms.memory.heap.max_size` and `dbms.memory.pagecache.size`.
Combined, they must not exceed the memory configuration of the Neo4j container. +
In Kubernetes, running processes in the Neo4j container, which exceed the configured memory limit are killed by the underlying operating system.
Therefore, it is recommended to allow an additional 1GB of memory headroom so that `heap + pagecache + 1GB < available memory`.
+
For example, a 5GB container could be configured like this:
+
[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "5Gi"

# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  dbms.memory.heap.initial_size: "3G"
  dbms.memory.heap.max_size: "3G"
  dbms.memory.pagecache.size: "1G"
----
+
`dbms.memory.pagecache.size` and `dbms.memory.heap.initial_size` are not the only settings available in Neo4j to manage memory usage.
For full details of how to configure memory usage in Neo4j, see xref:performance/memory-configuration.adoc[Performance - Memory Configuration].

[[k8s-service-accounts]]
== Configure a service account

In some deployment situations, it may be desirable to assign a Kubernetes Service Account to the Neo4j pod.
For example, if processes in the pod want to connect to services that require Service Account authorization.
To configure the Neo4j pod to use a Kubernetes service account, set `podSpec.serviceAccountName` to the name of the service account to use.

For example:

[source, yaml]
----
# neo4j-values.yaml
neo4j:
  password: "my-password"

podSpec:
  serviceAccountName: "neo4j-service-account"
----

[NOTE]
====
The service account must already exist.
In the case of clusters, the Neo4j Helm chart creates and configures the service account.
====

[[configure-custom-image]]
== Configure a custom container image

The helm chart uses the official Neo4j Docker image that matches the version of the Helm chart.
To configure the helm chart to use a different container image, set the `image.customImage` property in the _values.yaml_ file.

This can be necessary when public container repositories are not accessible for security reasons.
For example, this _values.yaml_ file configures Neo4j to use `my-container-repository.io` as the container repository:

[source, properties, subs=attributes]
----
# neo4j-values.yaml
neo4j:
  password: "my-password"

image:
  customImage: "my-container-repository.io/neo4j:{neo4j-version}-enterprise"
----

[[operations-using-apoc-core]]
== Configure and install APOC core only

APOC core is shipped with Neo4j, but it is not installed in the Neo4j _plugins_ directory.
If APOC core is the _only_ plugin that you want to add to Neo4j, it is not necessary to perform plugin installation as described in xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#operations-installing-plugins[Install Plugins].
Instead, you can configure the helm deployment to use APOC core by upgrading the deployment with these additional settings in the _values.yaml_ file:

. Configure APOC core by loading and unresticting the functions and procedures you need (for more details see link:https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.4/installation/#restricted[APOC installation guide]).
For example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
config:
  dbms.directories.plugins: "/var/lib/neo4j/labs"
  dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted: "apoc.cypher.doIt"
  dbms.security.procedures.allowlist: "apoc.math.maxInteger,apoc.cypher.doIt"
----
+
. Under `apoc_config`, configure the APOC settings you want, for example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apoc_config:
  apoc.trigger.enabled: "true"
  apoc.jdbc.neo4j.url: "jdbc:foo:bar"
  apoc.import.file.enabled: "true"
----
+
. Run `helm upgrade` to apply the changes:
+
[source, shell]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> neo4j/neo4j-standalone -f values.yaml
----

. After the Helm upgrade rollout is complete, verify that APOC core has been configured by running the following Cypher query using `cypher-shell` or Neo4j Browser:
+
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.version()
----
+
. Verify the APOC configs using the `apoc.config.list()` procedure:
+
[source, cypher]
----
CALL apoc.config.list() YIELD key, value WHERE key = "apoc.jdbc.neo4j.url" RETURN *;
----

== Configure credentials for plugin's aliases using APOC-extended

From 4.4.23, the Neo4j Helm chart supports configuring credentials for the plugin's aliases using a Kubernetes secret mounted on the provided path.
This feature is available `apoc.jdbc.<aliasname>.url` and `apoc.es.<aliasname>.url` via
APOC-extended.

[NOTE]
====
The secret must be created beforehand and must contain the key-named `URL`, otherwise, the Helm chart throws an error. For example:
`kubectl create secret generic jdbcsecret --from-literal=URL="jdbc:mysql://30.0.0.0:3306/Northwind?user=root&password=password"`
====

Under `apoc_credentials`, configure `aliasName`, `secretName`, and `secretMountPath`.
For example:

[source, yaml]
----
apoc_credentials: {}
#   jdbc:
#    aliasName: "jdbc"
#    secretName: "jdbcsecret"
#    secretMountPath: "/secret/jdbcCred"
#
#   elasticsearch:
#     aliasName: "es"
#     secretName: "essecret"
#     secretMountPath: "/secret/esCred"
----

[[operations-installing-plugins]]
== Install Plugins

There are three recommended methods for adding Neo4j plugins to Neo4j Helm chart deployments.
You can use:

* <<automatic-plugin-download, an automatic plugin download>>
* <<init-container-plugin-installation, an init container>>
* <<custom-container, a custom container image>>.
* <<plugins-volume, a `plugins` volume>>.

[[automatic-plugin-download]]
=== Add plugins using an automatic plugin download

You can configure the Neo4j deployment to automatically download and install plugins.
If licenses are required for the plugins, you must provide the licenses in a secret.

==== Install GDS Community Edition (CE)

GDS Community Edition does not require a license.
To add the GSD CE, configure the Neo4j _values.yaml_ and set the `env` to download the plugins:

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  name: licenses
  acceptLicenseAgreement: "yes"
  edition: enterprise
volumes:
  data:
    mode: defaultStorageClass
env:
  NEO4J_PLUGINS: '["graph-data-science"]'
config:
  dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted: "gds.*"
----

==== Install GDS Enterprise Edition (EE) and Bloom plugins

To install GDS EE and Bloom, you must provide a license for each plugin.
You provide the licenses in a secret.

. Create a secret containing the licenses:
+
[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret  generic --from-file=gds.license,bloom.license gds-bloom-license
----
. Configure the Neo4j _values.yaml_ file using the secret as the _/licenses_ volume mount, and set the `env` to download the plugins:
+
[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  name: licenses
  acceptLicenseAgreement: "yes"
  edition: enterprise
volumes:
  data:
    mode: defaultStorageClass
  licenses:
    mode: volume
    volume:
      secret:
        secretName: gds-bloom-license
        items:
          - key: gds.license
            path: gds.license
          - key: bloom.license
            path: bloom.license
env:
  NEO4J_PLUGINS: '["graph-data-science", "bloom"]'
config:
  gds.enterprise.license_file: "/licenses/gds.license"
  dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted: "gds.*,bloom.*"
  server.unmanaged_extension_classes: "com.neo4j.bloom.server=/bloom,semantics.extension=/rdf"
  dbms.security.http_auth_allowlist: "/,/browser.*,/bloom.*"
  dbms.bloom.license_file: "/licenses/bloom.license"
----

[[init-container-plugin-installation]]
=== Add plugins using an init container

Init containers are specialized containers that run before the main containers (in this case, the Neo4j container) in a pod.
You can use an init container to add plugins that have already been downloaded on an internal file server and are available to you via the internal network.

In the following example a YAML file, called _plugin_initContainer.yaml_ file, configures an init container to download the plugins, in this case, `apoc`, from an internal file server to the _/plugins_ directory, which is backed by a persistent volume.
Then, it deploys a Neo4j standalone server.
When the Neo4j container starts, it automatically installs the plugins from the _/plugins_ directory.

. Configure what operations the init container should run using the `initContainers` property in the _plugin_initContainer.yaml_ file.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some Neo4j plugins, such as Bloom and GDS Enterprise, require a license activation key, which needs to be placed in a directory accessible by the Neo4j Docker container, for example, mounted to _/licenses_ (default).
To obtain a valid license, reach out to your Neo4j account representative or write to licensing@neo4j.com.

+
[source, shell]
----
helm install neo4j neo4j/neo4j-standalone -f ~/path/to/plugin_initContainer.yaml
----
. After the pod changes its status from `Init` to `Running`, verify that the mount has the _apoc.jar_:
+
[source, role=noheader]
----
k exec -it standalone-0 -- bash
----
+
.Example output
[source, role=noheader]
----
neo4j@standalone-0:/$ cd /plugins

----
+
Wait for the pod to change its state to `READY`.
. Using the `<EXTERNAL-IP>` of the LoadBalancer service, open the Neo4j Browser at _\http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:7474/browser_.
. Use the password that you have configured in the _plugin_initContainer.yaml_ file.
. Run a query to verify that the Apoc plugin is installed and configured.
For example, you can use the following query to get the value of your jdbc URL:
+
[source, shell]
----
CALL apoc.config.list() YIELD key, value WHERE key = "apoc.jdbc.neo4j.url" RETURN *;
----
+
It should return `"jdbc:foo:bar"` as configured in the `apoc.config`.

[[custom-container]]
=== Add plugins using a custom container image

The best method for adding plugins to Neo4j running in Kubernetes is to create a new Docker container image that contains both Neo4j and the Neo4j plugins.
This way, you can ensure when building the container that the correct plugin version for the Neo4j version of the container is used and that the resulting image encapsulates all Neo4j runtime dependencies.

[NOTE]
====
The Neo4j Bloom plugin (https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/#tools-tab) requires a license activation key, which needs to be placed in a directory accessible by the Neo4j Docker container, for example, mounted to _/licenses_ (default).
To obtain a valid license, reach out to your Neo4j account representative or write to licensing@neo4j.com.
====

Building a Docker container image that is based on the official Neo4j Docker image and does not override the official image's `ENTRYPOINT` and `COMMAND` is the recommended method to use with the Neo4j Helm chart, as shown in this example Dockerfile:

[source, Dockerfile, subs=attributes]
----
ARG  NEO4J_VERSION
FROM neo4j:\{NEO4J_VERSION}

# copy my-plugins into the Docker image
COPY my-plugins/ /var/lib/neo4j/plugins

# install the apoc core plugin that is shipped with Neo4j
RUN cp /var/lib/neo4j/labs/apoc-* /var/lib/neo4j/plugins
----

Once the docker image has been built, push it to a container repository that is accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.

[source, shell, subs=attributes]
----
CONTAINER_REPOSITORY="my-container-repository.io"
IMAGE_NAME="my-neo4j"

# export this so that it's accessible as a docker build arg
export NEO4J_VERSION={neo4j-version-exact}-enterprise

docker build --build-arg NEO4J_VERSION --tag $\{CONTAINER_REPOSITORY}/$\{IMAGE_NAME}:$\{NEO4J_VERSION} .
docker push $\{CONTAINER_REPOSITORY}/$\{IMAGE_NAME}:$\{NEO4J_VERSION}
----

To use the image that you have created, in the Neo4j Helm deployment's _values.yaml_ file, set `image.customImage` to use the image.
For more details, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#configure-custom-image[Configure a custom container image].

[NOTE]
====
Many plugins require additional Neo4j configuration to work correctly.
Plugin configuration should be set on the `config` object in the Helm deployment's _values.yaml_ file.
In some cases, plugin configuration can cause Neo4j's strict config validation to fail.
Strict config validation can be disabled by setting `dbms.config.strict_validation: "false"`.
====

[[plugins-volume]]
=== Add plugins using a plugins volume

An alternative method for adding Neo4j plugins to a Neo4j Helm deployment uses a `plugins` volume mount.
With this method, the plugin jar files are stored on a Persistent Volume that is mounted to the `/plugins` directory of the Neo4j container.

[NOTE]
====
The Neo4j Bloom plugin (https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/#tools-tab) requires a license activation key, which needs to be placed in a directory accessible by the Neo4j Docker container, for example, mounted to _/licenses_ (default).
To obtain a valid license, reach out to your Neo4j account representative or write to licensing@neo4j.com.
====

The simplest way to set up a persistent _/plugins_ volume is to share the Persistent Volume that is used for storing Neo4j data.
This example shows how to configure that in the Neo4j Helm deployment _values.yaml_ file:

[source, yaml]
----
# neo4j-values.yaml
volumes:
  data:
    # your data volume configuration
    ...

  plugins:
    mode: "share"
    share:
      name: "data"
----

Details of different ways to configure volume mounts are covered in xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc#volume-mounts[Mapping volume mounts to persistent volumes].

The Neo4j container now has an empty `/plugins` directory backed by a persistent volume.
Plugin jar files can be copied onto the volume using `kubectl cp`.
Because it is backed by a persistent volume, plugin files will persist even if the Neo4j pod is restarted or moved.

[NOTE]
====
Neo4j loads plugins only on startup.
Therefore, you must restart the Neo4j pod to load them once all plugins are in place.
====

For example:

[source, shell]
----
# Copy plugin files into the Neo4j container:

kubectl cp my-plugins/* <namespace>/<neo4j-pod-name>:/plugins/

# Restart Neo4j
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/<neo4j-statefulset-name>

# Verify plugins are still present after the restart:

kubectl exec <neo4j-pod-name> -- ls /plugins
----
