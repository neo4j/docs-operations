:description: This section describes how to configure and install a Neo4j helm deployment in a Kubernetes cluster using a customized Helm chart.
[[kubernetes-neo4j-configuration]]
= Customizing a Neo4j Helm chart

Helm is different from “package managers”, such as `apt`, `yum`, and `npm`, because, in addition to installing applications, Helm allows rich configuration of applications.
The customized configuration should be expressed declaratively in a YAML formatted file, and then passed during installation.

[TIP]
====
For more information, see link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing[Helm official documentation].
====

[[si-config-parameters]]
== Important configuration parameters

The following is a list of the most important configuration parameters for the Neo4j Helm chart.
For a full list of configuration parameters, run  `helm show values`.
See xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#create-yaml[Create a custom _values.yaml_ file].

=== `neo4j.name`

Starting from Neo4j 5.0.0, standalone servers and cluster servers have no distinction.
This means a standalone server can be upgraded to a cluster by adding more servers.
Therefore, the `neo4j.name` parameter, which value links together servers in a cluster, is mandatory, and the installation will fail if it is not specified.
`neo4j.name` must be unique within a namespace.

=== `neo4j.resources`

The resources (CPU, memory) for the Neo4j container are configured by setting `neo4j.resources` object in the _values.yaml_ file.
In the resource _requests_, you can specify how much CPU and memory the Neo4j container needs, while in the resource _limits_, you can set a limit on these resources in case the container tries to use more resources than its _requests_ allow.
//For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[the Kubernetes container resources documentation].

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  resources:
    requests:
     cpu: "1000m"
     memory: "2Gi"
    limits:
     cpu: "2000m"
     memory: "4Gi"
----

If no resource _requests_ and resource _limits_ are specified, the values set in the `resources` object are used for both the Neo4j container's resource _requests_ and resource _limits_.

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "5Gi"
----

[NOTE]
====
The minimum for a Neo4j instance is `0.5` CPU and `2GB` memory. +
If invalid or less than the minimum values are provided, Helm will throw an error, for example:

[source, role=noheader]
----
Error: template: neo4j-standalone/templates/_helpers.tpl:157:11: executing "neo4j.resources.evaluateCPU" at <fail (printf "Provided cpu value %s is less than minimum. \n %s" (.Values.neo4j.resources.cpu) (include "neo4j.resources.invalidCPUMessage" .))>: error calling fail: Provided cpu value 0.25 is less than minimum.
 cpu value cannot be less than 0.5 or 500m
----
====

=== JVM heap and page cache

You configure Neo4j to use the memory provided to the container by setting the parameters `server.memory.heap.initial_size` and `server.memory.pagecache.size`.
Combined, they must not exceed the memory configuration of the Neo4j container. +
In Kubernetes, running processes in the Neo4j container, which exceed the configured memory limit are killed by the underlying operating system.
Therefore, it is recommended to allow an additional 1GB of memory headroom so that `heap + pagecache + 1GB < available memory`.

For example, a 5GB container could be configured like this:

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "5Gi"

# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  server.memory.heap.initial_size: "3G"
  server.memory.heap.max_size: "3G"
  server.memory.pagecache.size: "1G"
----

`server.memory.pagecache.size` and `server.memory.heap.initial_size` are not the only settings available in Neo4j to manage memory usage.
For full details of how to configure memory usage in Neo4j, see xref:performance/memory-configuration.adoc[Performance - Memory Configuration].

=== `neo4j.password`
The password for the `neo4j` user. +
You can set an initial password for accessing Neo4j in the _values.yaml_ file.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use `neo4j` as the initial password as this is the default password.
====

If no initial password is set, the Neo4j helm chart will automatically generate one.
(Make a note of it.)
In cluster deployments, the same password must be set for all cluster members.

[source, yaml]
----
neo4j:
 # If not set or empty a random password will be generated
 password: ""
----

The password will be printed out in the Helm install output, unless `--set logInitialPassword=false` is used.

The initial Neo4j password is stored in a _Kubernetes Secret_.
The password can be extracted from the _Secret_ using this command:

[source, shell]
----
kubectl get secret <release-name>-auth -oyaml | yq -r '.data.NEO4J_AUTH' | base64 -d
----

[TIP]
====
To change the initial password, follow the steps in xref:kubernetes/operations/reset-password.adoc[Reset the neo4j user password].

Once you change the password in Neo4j, the password stored in _Kubernetes Secrets_ will still exist but will no longer be valid.
====

=== `neo4j.edition` and `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement`

By default, the Helm chart installs Neo4j Community Edition. +
If you want to install Neo4j Enterprise Edition, set the configuration parameters `edition: "enterprise"` and acknowledge license compliance by setting `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement` to `"yes"` if you have a valid license or to `"eval"` if you want to accept the link:https://neo4j.com/terms/enterprise_us/[Neo4j evaluation license]. +
For more information on how to obtain a valid license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition, see https://neo4j.com/licensing/ and link:https://neo4j.com/terms/licensing/, or use the form https://neo4j.com/contact-us[Contact Neo4j].

=== `volumes.data`

The `volumes.data` parameter maps the `data` volume mount of your Neo4j to the persistent volume that you have for that instance.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc[Volume mounts and persistent volumes].

=== `neo4j.minimumClusterSize`

By default, servers in a cluster can host primary and secondary databases.
See the xref:clustering/introduction.adoc[clustering documentation] for more details. +
`neo4j.minimumClusterSize` is set to 1 by default, which means the server starts without waiting for the other servers.
When installing a cluster, you should set `neo4j.minimumClusterSize` to the number of desired members in the cluster.
If you later decide to add an extra cluster server in excess of `neo4j.minimumClusterSize`, you need to manually enable it using the Cypher command `ENABLE SERVER`.
For more information on enabling new servers, see xref:clustering/servers.adoc#cluster-add-server[Add a server to the cluster].

=== `config`
The Neo4j Helm chart does not use a `neo4j.conf` file.
Instead, the Neo4j configuration is set in the Helm deployment's _values.yaml_ file under the `config` object.

The `config` object should contain a string map of _neo4j.conf_ setting name to value.
For example, this `config` object configures the Neo4j metrics:

[source, yaml]
----
# Neo4j configuration (yaml format)
config:
  server.metrics.enabled: "true"
  server.metrics.csv.interval: "10s"
  server.metrics.csv.rotation.keep_number: "2"
  server.metrics.csv.rotation.compression: "NONE"
----

[NOTE]
====
All Neo4j `config` values must be YAML strings.
It is important to put quotes around the values, such as `"true"`, `"false"`, and `"2"`, so that they are handled correctly as strings.
====

All _neo4j.conf_ settings are supported except for `server.jvm.additional`.
Additional JVM settings can be set on the `jvm` object in the Helm deployment _values.yaml_ file, as shown in the example:

[source, java]
----
# Jvm configuration for Neo4j
jvm:
  additionalJvmArguments:
  - "-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError"
  - "-XX:HeapDumpPath=/logs/neo4j.hprof"
----

To find out more about configuring Neo4j and the _neo4j.conf_ file, see xref:configuration/index.adoc[Configuration] and xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[The neo4j.conf file].

=== `image.customImage`

The helm chart uses the official Neo4j Docker image that matches the version of the Helm chart.
To configure the helm chart to use a different container image, set the `image.customImage` property in the _values.yaml_ file.

This can be necessary when public container repositories are not accessible for security reasons.
For example, this _values.yaml_ file configures Neo4j to use `my-container-repository.io` as the container repository:

[source, properties, subs=attributes]
----
# neo4j-values.yaml
neo4j:
  password: "my-password"

image:
  customImage: "my-container-repository.io/neo4j:{neo4j-version}-enterprise"
----

=== Other configuration options

Some examples of possible Neo4j configurations::
* All Neo4j configuration (_neo4j.conf_) settings can be set directly on the `config` object in the _values.yaml_ file.
* Neo4j can be configured to use SSL certificates contained in Kubernetes Secrets by modifying the `ssl` object in the values file.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/security.adoc[Configure SSL].


Some examples of possible K8s configurations::
* Configure (or disable completely) the Kubernetes LoadBalancer that exposes Neo4j outside the Kubernetes cluster by modifying the `externalService` object in the _values.yml_ file.
* Set the `securityContext` used by Neo4j Pods by modifying the `securityContext` object in the _values.yml_ file.
* Configure manual persistent volume provisioning or set the `StorageClass` to be used as the Neo4j persistent storage.

[[create-yaml]]
== Create a custom _values.yaml_ file

. Ensure your Neo4j Helm chart repository is up to date and get the latest charts.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/helm-charts-setup.adoc[Configure the Neo4j Helm chart repository].
. To see what options are configurable on the Neo4j helm chart that you want to deploy, use `helm show values` and the Helm chart _neo4j/neo4j_.
For example:
+
[source, shell]
--
helm show values neo4j/neo4j
--
+
