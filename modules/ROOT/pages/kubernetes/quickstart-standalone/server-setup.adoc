= Neo4j Helm chart for standalone server deployments

In the standalone server setup, the user is responsible for defining a single YAML file, containing all the configurations for the Neo4j standalone instance, and for running the `helm install my-neo4j-release neo4j/neo4j -f values.yaml` command to deploy the Neo4j DBMS.
Then, the Neo4j Helm chart creates Kubernetes entities needed for running and accessing Neo4j.

The following diagram is a schematic representation of the Helm chart and the Kubernetes and Cloud resources it instantiates when installed:
