= Neo4j Helm chart for standalone server deployments

In the standalone server setup, the user is responsible for defining a single YAML file, containing all the configurations for the Neo4j standalone instance, and for running the `helm install my-neo4j-release neo4j/neo4j -f values.yaml` command to deploy the Neo4j DBMS.
Then, the Neo4j Helm chart creates Kubernetes entities needed for running and accessing Neo4j.

See this schematic representation of the Helm chart and the Kubernetes and Cloud resources it instantiates when installed:

.User creates
[source]
--
neo4j:
	edition: community
	name: my-neo4j
volumes:
	data:
	mode: “defaultStorageClass”
--

.User executes
[source,shell]

helm install my-neo4j neo4j/neo4j -f values.yaml
