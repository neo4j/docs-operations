:description: Create a standalone deployment yaml file.
[[si-create-value-file]]
= Create a Helm deployment _values.yaml_ file

You create a Helm deployment YAML file containing all the configurations for your Neo4j standalone instance.

[[si-config-parameters]]
== Important configuration parameters

`neo4j.name`::
Standalone servers and cluster servers have no distinction.
This means a standalone server can be upgraded to a cluster by adding more servers.
Therefore, the `neo4j.name` parameter, which value links together servers in a cluster, is mandatory, and the installation will fail if it is not specified.
`neo4j.name` must be unique within a namespace.

`neo4j.resources`::
The size of a Neo4j instance is defined by the values of the `neo4j.resources.cpu` and `neo4j.resources.memory` parameters.
The minimum is `0.5` CPU and `2GB` memory.
If invalid or less than the minimum values are provided, Helm will throw an error, for example:
+
[source,go,role=noheader]
----
Error: template: neo4jtemplates/_helpers.tpl:157:11: executing "neo4j.resources.evaluateCPU" at <fail (printf "Provided cpu value %s is less than minimum. \n %s" (.Values.neo4j.resources.cpu) (include "neo4j.resources.invalidCPUMessage" .))>: error calling fail: Provided cpu value 0.25 is less than minimum.
 cpu value cannot be less than 0.5 or 500m
----
+
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#configure-resources[Configure resource allocation].

`neo4j.password`::
The password for the `neo4j` user. +
If you do not provide a password, the Neo4j Helm chart will automatically generate one for you.
(Make a note of it.)
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot use `neo4j` as the initial password as this is the default password.
====

`neo4j.edition` and `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement`::
By default, the standalone Helm chart installs Neo4j Community Edition. +
If you want to install Neo4j Enterprise Edition, set the configuration parameters `edition: "enterprise"` and acknowledge license compliance by setting `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement` to `"yes"` if you have a valid license or to `"eval"` if you want to accept the link:https://neo4j.com/terms/enterprise_us/[Neo4j evaluation license]. +
For more information on how to obtain a valid license for Neo4j Enterprise Edition, see https://neo4j.com/licensing/ and link:https://neo4j.com/terms/licensing/, or use the form https://neo4j.com/contact-us[Contact Neo4j].

`volumes.data`::
The `volumes.data` parameter maps the `data` volume mount of your Neo4j to the persistent volume that you have for that instance.
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/persistent-volumes.adoc[Volume mounts and persistent volumes].
[NOTE]
====
For details of all Neo4j Helm chart configuration options, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc[Configure a Neo4j Helm deployment].

[[server-values-yaml]]
== Create a _values.yaml_ file

Select the tab as per your Kubernetes environment and using the provided example, create a YAML file for your standalone instance.

This guide assumes that the YAML file is named _my-neo4j.values.yaml_.
