[[si-create-value-file]]
= Create a Helm deployment _values.yaml_ file

You create a Helm deployment YAML file containing all the configurations for your Neo4j standalone instance.

[[si-config-parameters]]
== Important configuration parameters

`neo4j.resources`::
The size of a Neo4j instance is defined by the values of the `neo4j.resources.cpu` and `neo4j.resources.memory` parameters.
The minimum is `0.5` CPU and `2GB` memory.
If invalid or less than the minimum values are provided, Helm will throw an error, for example:
+
[source,go,role=noheader]
----
Error: template: neo4j-standalone/templates/_helpers.tpl:157:11: executing "neo4j.resources.evaluateCPU" at <fail (printf "Provided cpu value %s is less than minimum. \n %s" (.Values.neo4j.resources.cpu) (include "neo4j.resources.invalidCPUMessage" .))>: error calling fail: Provided cpu value 0.25 is less than minimum. 
 cpu value cannot be less than 0.5 or 500m
----
+
For more information, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc#configure-resources[Configure resource allocation].

`neo4j.password`::
The password for the `neo4j` user. +
If you do not provide a password, the Neo4j Helm chart will automatically generate one for you.
(Make a note of it.)
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot use `neo4j` as the initial password as this is the default password.
====

`neo4j.edition` and `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement`::
By default, the standalone Helm chart installs Neo4j Community Edition.
If you want to install Neo4j Enterprise Edition, set the configuration parameters `edition: "enterprise"` and acknowledge license compliance by setting `neo4j.acceptLicenseAgreement` to `"yes"`.

`volumes.data`::
The `volumes.data` parameter maps the `data` volume mount of your Neo4j to the persistent volume that you have created for that instance.
See xref:kubernetes/quickstart-standalone/create-pv.adoc[Create a persistent volume].
+
[NOTE]
====
For details of all Neo4j Helm chart configuration options, see xref:kubernetes/configuration.adoc[Configure a Neo4j Helm deployment].

[[cc-core-values-yaml]]
== Create a values.yaml file

Select the tab as per your Kubernetes environment and using the provided example, create a YAML file for your standalone instance. 

This guide assumes that the YAML file is named _my-neo4j.values.yaml_.
