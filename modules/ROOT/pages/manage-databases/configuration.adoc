== Administrative commands

[NOTE]
====
Administrative commands should not be used during a rolling upgrade.
For more information, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/upgrade-migration-guide/upgrade/upgrade-4.4/causal-cluster/[Upgrade and Migration Guide -> Upgrade a cluster].

For detailed information on Cypher administrative commands, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/databases[Cypher Manual -> Database management].
====

Before using administrative commands, it is important to understand the difference between stopped databases, and dropped databases:

* Databases that are stopped with the `STOP` command are completely shutdown, and may be started again through the `START` command.
In a cluster, as long as a database is in a shutdown state, it can not be considered available to other members of the cluster.
It is not possible to do online backups against shutdown databases and they need to be taken into special consideration during disaster recovery, as they do not have a running Raft machine while shutdown.
* Dropped databases are completely removed and are not intended to be used again at all.

The following Cypher commands are used on the `system` database to manage multiple databases:

[options="header" cols="m,a"]
|===
| Command
| Description

| CREATE DATABASE name
| Create and start a new database. label:enterprise-edition[]

| DROP DATABASE name
| Drop (remove) an existing database. label:enterprise-edition[]

| ALTER DATABASE name
| Alter (modify) an existing database. label:enterprise-edition[]

| START DATABASE name
| Start a database that has been stopped.

| STOP DATABASE name
| Shut down a database.

| SHOW DATABASE name
| Show the status of a specific database.

| SHOW DATABASES
| Show the name and status of all the databases.

| SHOW DEFAULT DATABASE
| Show the name and status of the default database.

| SHOW HOME DATABASE
| Show the name and status of the home database for the current user.
|===


Naming rules for databases are as follows:

* Length must be between 3 and 63 characters.
* The first character of a name must be an ASCII alphabetic character.
* Subsequent characters must be ASCII alphabetic or numeric characters, dots or dashes; `[a..z][0..9].-`
* Names are case-insensitive and normalized to lowercase.
* Names that begin with an underscore and with the prefix `system` are reserved for internal use.

[NOTE]
====
All of the above commands are executed as Cypher commands, and the database name is subject to the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/syntax/naming[standard Cypher restrictions on valid identifiers].
In particular, the `-` (dash) and `.` (dot) characters are not legal in Cypher variables, and therefore names with dashes must be enclosed within back-ticks.
For example, `CREATE DATABASE ++`main-db`++`.
Database names are the only identifier for which dots don't need to be escaped.
For example, `main.db` is a valid database name.
====

It is possible to create an alias to refer to an existing database to avoid these restrictions.
For more information, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/aliases#alias-management-create-database-alias[Cypher Manual -> Creating database aliases].

For detailed information on Cypher administrative commands, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/access-control[Cypher Manual -> Access Control].

For examples of using the Cypher administrative commands to manage multiple active databases, see xref:manage-databases/queries.adoc[Queries].


[[manage-databases-parameters]]
== Configuration parameters

Configuration parameters are defined in the xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[neo4j.conf] file.

The following configuration parameters are applicable for managing databases:

[options="header", cols="40,60"]
|===
| Parameter name
| Description

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_initial.dbms.default_database[`initial.dbms.default_database`]
a|
Name of the default database for the Neo4j instance.
The database is created if it does not exist when the instance starts.

*Default value:* `neo4j`

[NOTE]
====
In a clustered setup, the value of `initial.dbms.default_database` is only used to set the initial default database.
To change the default database at a later point, see xref:clustering/databases#cluster-default-database[Change the default database].
====

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that the automatically created _initial_ default database may have a different topology to the default configuration values.
See xref:clustering/clustering-advanced/default-database.adoc[Default database in a cluster] for more information.
====

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.max_databases[`dbms.max_databases`]
a|
Maximum number of databases that can be used in a Neo4j single instance or cluster.
The number includes all the online and offline databases.
The value is an integer with a minimum value of 2.
label:enterprise-edition[]

*Default value:* `100`

[NOTE]
====
Once the limit has been reached, it is not possible to create any additional databases.
Similarly, if the limit is changed to a number lower than the total number of existing databases, no additional databases can be created.
====

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.databases.default_to_read_only[`server.databases.default_to_read_only`]
a|
Default mode of all databases.
If this setting is set to `true` all existing and new databases will be in read only mode, and so will prevent write queries.

*Default value:* `false`

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.databases.read_only[`server.databases.read_only`]
a|
List of database names for which to prevent write queries.
This set can contain also not yet existing databases, but not the `system` database.

[NOTE]
====
Regardless of settings of `server.databases.default_to_read_only`, `server.databases.read_only` and `dbms.databases.writable` the `system` database will never be read-only and will always accept write queries.
====

[NOTE]
====
Another way of preventing writes is to set the database access to read-only using the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/databases#administration-databases-alter-database[ALTER DATABASE] command.
====


Example configuration:
[source, example, role="noheader"]
----
server.databases.read_only=["foo", "bar"]
----

| xref:configuration/dynamic-settings.adoc#config_dbms.databases.writable[`dbms.databases.writable`]
a|
List of database names for which to accept write queries.
This set can contain also not yet existing databases. +
The value of this setting is ignored if `server.databases.default_to_read_only` is set to `false`. +
If a database name is present in both sets, the database will be read-only and prevent write queries.

[[config-param-note-3]]
[TIP]
====
If most of your databases would read-only with a few exceptions, it can be easier to set `config_server.databases.default_to_read_only` to `true`, and then put the names of the non read-only databases into `dbms.databases.writeable`.
====

Example configuration:
[source, example, role="noheader"]
----
dbms.databases.writable=["foo", "bar"]
----
|===

[NOTE]
====
Although it is possible to achieve the same goal, i.e. set a database to read-only, both by using the Cypher command `ALTER DATABASE` and by using configuration parameters in `neo4j.conf`, it is important to understand the difference between the two.
`ALTER DATABASE foo SET ACCESS READ ONLY` effectively sets the database `foo` to read-only _across the entire DBMS_.

Using configuration parameters is more subtle and allows you to configure access on each instance separately, in case of a cluster for example.
If you use `server.databases.default_to_read_only` _all databases on that instance_ are set to read-only.

If both the Cypher command and the configuration parameters are used and they contain conflicting information, the database in question is set to read-only.
