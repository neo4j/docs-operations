== Concepts

With Neo4j {neo4j-version} you can create and use more than one active database at the same time.

DBMS::
Neo4j is a Database Management System, or _DBMS_, capable of managing multiple databases.
The DBMS can manage a standalone server, or a group of servers in a Causal Cluster.

Instance::
A Neo4j instance is a Java process that is running the Neo4j server code.

Transaction domain::
A transaction domain is a collection of graphs that can be updated within the context of a single transaction.

Execution context::
An execution context is a runtime environment for the execution of a request.
In practical terms, a request may be a query, a transaction, or an internal function or procedure.

Database::
A database is an administrative partition of a DBMS.
In practical terms, it is a physical structure of files organized within a directory or folder, that has the same name of the database.
In logical terms, a database is a container for one or more graphs.
+
A database defines a _transaction domain_ and an _execution context_.
This means that a transaction cannot span across multiple databases.
Similarly, a procedure is called within a database, although its logic may access data that is stored in other databases.
+
A default installation of Neo4j {neo4j-version} contains two databases:
+
* `system` - xref:manage-databases/introduction.adoc#manage-databases-system[the system database], containing metadata on the DBMS and security configuration.
* `neo4j` - xref:manage-databases/introduction.adoc#manage-databases-default[the default database], a single database for user data.
This has a default name of `neo4j`.
A different name can be configured before starting Neo4j for the first time.

Graph::
This is a data model within a database.
In Neo4j 4.0 there is only one graph within each database, and many administrative commands that refer to a specific graph do so using the database name.
+
In xref:fabric/index.adoc[Neo4j Fabric], it is possible to refer to multiple graphs within the same transaction and Cypher query.

The following image illustrates a default installation, including the `system` database and a single database named `neo4j` for user data:

.Editions
[NOTE]
====
The edition of Neo4j determines the number of possible databases:

* Installations of Community Edition can have exactly *one* user database.
* Installations of Enterprise Edition can have any number of user databases.

All installations include the `system` database.

[[manage-databases-system]]
== The `system` database

All installations include a built-in database named `system`, which contains meta-data and security configuration.

The `system` database behaves differently than all other databases.
In particular, when connected to this database you can only perform a specific set of administrative functions, as described in detail in link:/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/databases[Cypher Manual -> Database management].

Most of the available administrative commands are restricted to users with specific administrative privileges.
An example of configuring security privileges is described in xref:authentication-authorization/access-control.adoc[Fine-grained access control].
Security administration is described in detail in link:/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/access-control[Cypher Manual -> Access Control] .

The following image illustrates an installation of Neo4j with multiple active databases, named `marketing`, `sales`, and `hr`:

[[manage-databases-default]]
== The default and home database

If a user connects to Neo4j without specifying a database, they will be connected to a home database.
When choosing a home database the server will first use the home database xref:manage-databases/introduction.adoc#manage-databases-home[configured for that user].
If the connecting user does not have a home database configured, the server will use the default database, which every Neo4j instance has.

The default database is configurable.
For details, see xref:manage-databases/configuration.adoc#manage-databases-parameters[configuration parameters].

The following image illustrates an installation of Neo4j containing the three databases for user data, named `marketing`, `sales` and `hr`, and the `system` database.
The default database is `sales`:

[[manage-databases-home]]
== Per-user home databases

Per-user home databases are controlled via the Cypher administration commands.

To set a home database for a user, this user must exist as a record in Neo4j.
Therefore, for deployments using xref:authentication-authorization/introduction.adoc[auth providers] other than native, you create a native user with a matching username and then set a home database for that user.
For more information on creating native users and configuring a home database for a user, see link:/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/access-control/manage-users[Cypher Manual -> User Management].
