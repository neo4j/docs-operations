[[cypher-shell-about]]
== About Cypher Shell CLI

Cypher Shell is a command-line tool that comes with the Neo4j distribution.
It can also be downloaded from link:https://neo4j.com/download-center/#cypher-shell[Neo4j Download Center] and installed separately.

Cypher Shell CLI is used to run queries and perform administrative tasks against a Neo4j instance.
By default, the shell is interactive, but you can also use it for scripting by passing Cypher directly on the command line or by piping a file with Cypher statements (requires PowerShell on Windows).
It communicates via the Bolt protocol.

[[cypher-shell-syntax]]
== Syntax

The Cypher Shell CLI is located in the `bin` directory if installed as part of the product.

[[cypher-shell-run]]
== Running Cypher Shell within the Neo4j distribution

You can connect to a live Neo4j DBMS by running `cypher-shell` and passing in a username and a password argument:

[source, shell]
----
bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <password>
----

The output is the following:

[queryresult]
----
Connected to Neo4j at neo4j://localhost:7687 as user neo4j.
Type :help for a list of available commands or :exit to exit the shell.
Note that Cypher queries must end with a semicolon.
----

[[cypher-shell-standalone]]
== Running Cypher Shell from a different server

You can also install the Cypher Shell tool on a different server (without Neo4j) and connect to a Neo4j DBMS.
Cypher Shell requires Java 17.

[NOTE]
====
DEB/RPM distributions both install Java, if it is not already installed, and the Cypher Shell executable.
The _cypher-shell_ files are available in the same DEB/RPM Linux repositories as Neo4j.

The TAR distribution contains only the _cypher-shell_ files, so you must install Java manually.
====

. Download Cypher Shell from link:https://neo4j.com/download-center/#cypher-shell[Neo4j Download Center].
. Connect to a Neo4j DBMS by running the `cypher-shell` command providing the Neo4j address, a username, and a password:
+
[source, shell]
----
cypher-shell/cypher-shell -a neo4j://IP-address:7687 -u neo4j -p <password>
----
+
The output is the following:
+
[queryresult]
----
Connected to Neo4j at neo4j://IP-address:7687 as user neo4j.
Type :help for a list of available commands or :exit to exit the shell.
Note that Cypher queries must end with a semicolon.
----

[[cypher-shell-commands]]
== Available commands

Once in the interactive shell, run the following command to display all available commands:

.Running `help`
====

[source, shell]

[[cypher-shell-statements]]
== Running Cypher statements

You can run Cypher statements in the following ways:

* Typing Cypher statements directly into the interactive shell.
* Running Cypher statements from a file with the interactive shell.
* Running Cypher statements from a file as a `cypher-shell` argument.

The examples in this section use the `MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 5` Cypher statement and will return 5 nodes from the database.

.Typing a Cypher statement directly into the interactive shell
====

[source, shell]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 5;
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The following two examples assume a file exists in the same folder you run the `cypher-shell` command from called `example.cypher` with the following contents:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 5;
----
====

.Running Cypher statements from a file with the interactive shell
====

You can use the `:source` command followed by the file name to run the Cypher statements in that file when in the Cypher interactive shell:

[source, shell]
----
:source /path/to/your/example.cypher
----
====

.Running Cypher statements from a file as a `cypher-shell` argument.
====

You can pass a file containing Cypher statements as an argument when running `cypher-shell`.

The examples here use the `--format plain` flag for a simple output.

*Using `cat` (UNIX)*

[source, shell]
----
cat example.cypher | bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <password> --format plain
----

*Using `type` (Windows)*

[source, shell]
----
type example.cypher | bin/cypher-shell.bat -u neo4j -p <password> --format plain
----
====

[[cypher-shell-parameters]]
== Query parameters

Cypher Shell supports querying based on parameters.
Use `:param <Cypher Map>` to set parameters or the older arrow syntax `:param name => <Cypher Expression>`.
List current parameters with `:param`.
Clear parameters with `:param clear`.

Parameters can be set to any Cypher expression.
Some expressions need to be evaluated online and require an open session.
The parameter expression is evaluated once.
For example, `:param {now: datetime()}` will set the parameter `now` to the current date and time at the time of setting the parameter.

.Use parameters within Cypher Shell
====

. Set the parameter `alias` to `Robin` and `born` to `date('1940-03-20')` using the `:param` keyword:
+
[source, shell]
----
:param {alias: 'Robin', born: date('1940-03-20')}
----
. Check the current parameters using the `:params` keyword:
+
[source, shell]
----
:param
----
+
[queryresult]
----
{
  alias: 'Robin',
  born: date('1981-08-01')
}
----
+
. Now use the `alias` and `born` parameters in a Cypher query:
+
[source, shell]
----
CREATE (:Person {name : 'Dick Grayson', alias : $alias, born: $born });
----
+
[queryresult]
----
Added 1 nodes, Set 3 properties, Added 1 labels
----
+
. Verify the result:
+
[queryresult]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n;
----
+
[queryresult]
----
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| n                                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Person {name: "Bruce Wayne", alias: "Batman"})                   |
| (:Person {name: "Selina Kyle", alias: ["Catwoman", "The Cat"]})    |
| (:Person {name: "Dick Grayson", alias: "Robin", born: 1940-03-20}) |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
3 rows available after 2 ms, consumed after another 2 ms
----
====

[[cypher-shell-transactions]]
== Transactions

Cypher Shell supports explicit and implicit transactions.
Transaction states are controlled using the keywords `:begin`, `:commit`, and `:rollback`.

Both explicit and implicit transactions run from Cypher Shell will have default transaction metadata attached that follows the convention
(see xref:monitoring/logging.adoc#attach-metadata-tx[Attach metadata to a transaction]).

.Use fine-grained transaction control
====
The example uses the dataset from the built-in Neo4j Browser guide, called MovieGraph.
For more information, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current/visual-tour/#guides[Neo4j Browser documentation].

. Run a query that shows there is only one person in the database, who is born in 1964.
+
[source, shell]
----
MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.born=1964 RETURN n.name AS name;
----
+
[queryresult]
----
+----------------+
| name           |
+----------------+
| "Keanu Reeves" |
+----------------+

1 row
ready to start consuming query after 9 ms, results consumed after another 0 ms
----
+
. Start a transaction and create another person born in the same year:
+
[source, shell]
----
:begin
neo4j# CREATE (:Person {name : 'Edward Mygma', born:1964});
----
+
[queryresult]
----
0 rows
ready to start consuming query after 38 ms, results consumed after another 0 ms
Added 1 nodes, Set 2 properties, Added 1 labels
----
+
. If you open a second Cypher Shell session and run the query from step 1, you will notice no changes from the latest `CREATE` statement.
+
[source, shell]
----
MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.born=1964 RETURN n.name AS name;
----
+
[queryresult]
----
+----------------+
| name           |
+----------------+
| "Keanu Reeves" |
+----------------+

1 row
ready to start consuming query after 9 ms, results consumed after another 0 ms
----
+
. Go back to the first session and commit the transaction.
+
[source, shell]
----
neo4j# :commit
----
. Now, if you run the query from step 1, you will see that Edward Mygma has been added to the database.
+
[source, shell]
----
MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.born=1964 RETURN n.name AS name;
----
+
[queryresult]
----
+----------------+
| name           |
+----------------+
| "Keanu Reeves" |
| "Edward Mygma" |
+----------------+

2 rows
ready to start consuming query after 1 ms, results consumed after another 1 ms
----
====

[[cypher-shell-procedures]]
== Procedures

Cypher Shell supports running any procedures for which the current user is authorized.

.Call the `dbms.showCurrentUser` procedure
====

[source, shell]
----
CALL dbms.showCurrentUser();
----

[queryresult]
----
+------------------------------+
| username | roles     | flags |
+------------------------------+
| "neo4j"  | ["admin"] | []    |
+------------------------------+

1 row available after 66 ms, consumed after another 2 ms
----
