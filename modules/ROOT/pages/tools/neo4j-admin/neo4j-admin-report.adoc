The `neo4j-admin server report` command collects information about the Neo4j deployment and saves it to an archive (ZIP/TAR) for remote assessments.

== Syntax

The `neo4j-admin server report` command has the following syntax:

[source,role=noheader]
----
neo4j-admin server report [-h]
                          [--expand-commands] [--list] [--verbose]
                          [--ignore-disk-space-check[=true|false]]
                          [--additional-config=<file>] [--database=<database>]
                          [--to-path=<path>] [<classifier>...] [COMMAND]
----

=== Description

The command collects information about the system and packages everything in an archive.
If you specify `all`, everything is included.
You can also finetune the selection by passing classifiers to the tool, e.g `logs tx threads`.

The Neo4j Admin report tool allows you to choose the databases for which you want to include database-specific information.
You can generate a report covering all databases in the DBMS, a specific database, or databases that match a specified pattern.
For example, if you run the command `neo4j-admin server report --database=ne*`, a report will be generated for all databases that start with "ne".
If not specified, the tool generates a report for all databases in the DBMS.

[NOTE]
====
The `--database` option determines from which database(s) the database-level information is collected.
It does not influence the DBMS-level information, which is gathered based on the specified classifiers.
====

This tool does not send any information automatically.
To share this information with the Neo4j Support organization, you have to send it manually.

| Description

| all
|
| Include all of the available classifiers.

| ccstate
|
| Include the current cluster state.

| config
|
| Include Neo4j configuration files.

| heap
| {check-mark}
| Include a heap dump.

| logs
|
| Include log files, e.g., _debug.log_, _neo4j.log_, etc.

| metrics
|
| Include the collected metrics.

| plugins
|
| Include a text view of the plugin directory (no files are collected).

| ps
|
| Include a list of running processes.

| raft
|
| Include the raft log.

| sysprop
| {check-mark}
| Include a list of Java system properties.

| threads
| {check-mark}
| Include a thread dump of the running instance.

| tree
|
| Include a text view of the folder structure of the data directory (no files are collected).

| tx
|
| Include transaction logs.
|===

The classifiers marked as _Online_ work only when you have a running Neo4j instance that the tool can find.

If no classifiers are specified, the following classifiers are used: `logs`, `config`, `plugins`, `tree`, `metrics`, `threads`, `sysprop`, `ps`, and `version`.

The reporting tool does not read any data from your database.
However, the heap, the raft logs, and the transaction logs may contain data.
Additionally, even though the standard _neo4j.conf_ file does not contain password information, for specific configurations, it may have this type of information.
Therefore, be aware of your organization's data security rules before using the classifiers `heap`, `tx`, `raft`, and `config`.

=== Options

The `neo4j-admin server report` command has the following options:

.`neo4j-admin server report` options
[options="header", cols="5m,6a,2m"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Default

|--additional-config=<file>footnote:[See xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc#_configuration[Tools -> Configuration] for details.]
|Configuration file with additional configuration.
|

|--database=<database>
|Name of the database to report for. Can contain * and ? for globbing. Note that * and ? have special meaning in some shells and might need to be escaped or used with quotes.
|*

|--expand-commands
|Allow command expansion in config value evaluation.
|

|-h, --help
|Show this help message and exit.
|

|--ignore-disk-space-check[=true\|false]
|Ignore disk full warning.
|false


|--list
|List all available classifiers.
|

|--to-path=<path>
|Destination directory for reports. Defaults to a system tmp directory.
|

|--verbose
|Enable verbose output.
|
|===

By default, the tool tries to estimate the final size of the report and uses that to assert that there is enough disk space available for it.
If there is not enough available space, the tool aborts.
However, this estimation is pessimistic and does not consider compression.
Therefore, if you are confident that you do have enough disk space, you can disable this check with the option `--ignore-disk-space-check`.

== Examples

[NOTE]
====
This tool uses the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/attach/index.html[Java Attach API] to gather data from a running Neo4j instance.
Therefore, it requires the Java JDK to run properly.

.Invoke `neo4j-admin server report` using the default classifiers
====

The following command gathers information about the Neo4j instance using the default classifiers and saves it to the default location:

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin server report

====

.Invoke `neo4j-admin server report` using all classifiers
====

The following command gathers information about the Neo4j instance using all classifiers and saves it to a specified location:

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin server report --to-path=./report all
----
====

.Invoke `neo4j-admin server report` to gather only logs and thread dumps
====

The following command gathers only logs and thread dumps from the running Neo4j instance and saves it to a specified location:

[source, shell]
