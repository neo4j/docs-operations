----

== Options

[options="header" cols="<20m,<20m,<60a"]
|===
| Option
| Default
| Description

|  --database
| neo4j
| Name of the database to push.

This argument cannot be used together with `--dump`.

|  --dump
|
| Path to an existing database dump for upload, in the format _/path/to/my-neo4j-database-dump-file_.

This argument cannot be used together with `--database`.

|  --dump-to
|
| Optional.

Target path for temporary database dump file to be uploaded, in the format _/path/to/temp-file_.

Used in combination with the `--database` argument.

|  --bolt-uri
|
| Bolt URI of the target database.
For example, `neo4j://mydatabaseid.databases.neo4j.io`.

|  --username
|
| Optional.

Username of the target database to push this database to.
If you do not provide a username, you will be prompted to provide one.
Alternatively, the `NEO4J_USERNAME` environment variable can be used.

|  --password
|
| Optional.

The password of the target database to push this database to.
If you do not provide a password, you will be prompted to provide one.
Alternatively, you can use the `NEO4J_PASSWORD` environment variable.

|  --overwrite
|
| Optional.

Overwrite the data in the target database.

|  --verbose
|
| Optional.

Enable verbose output.
|===

== Limitations

* A Neo4j Aura database must already be provisioned and running.
* Your local database must be stopped before you run the `push-to-cloud` command with the `--database` argument.
The `push-to-cloud` function cannot be used with a source database that is currently in use.

== Output

If the `push-to-cloud` function completes successfully, it exits with the following logline:

----
Your data was successfully pushed to Aura and is now running.
----

If the `push-to-cloud` function encounters an error at any point, you will be provided with instructions on how to try again or to contact Neo4j Aura support.
+
Additionally, you can use the `--verbose` option to enable verbose output.

== Examples

The following examples show how to use the `push-to-cloud` command to upload a database or a database dump to a Neo4j Aura instance.
You need your AuraDB instance URI (`neo4j+s://your-databaseid.databases.neo4j.io`), as can be seen in the Aura console, and your AuraDB instance password.

[NOTE]
====
You should use the `--overwrite` option to overwrite the target database.
Otherwise, the command aborts and throws an error.
