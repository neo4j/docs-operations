:description: This chapter describes the `memory-recommendation` command of Neo4j Admin.
[[neo4j-admin-memrec]]
= Memory recommendations

You can use the `neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation` command to get an initial recommendation on how to configure the memory parameters of your Neo4j DBMS.

== Syntax

The `neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation` command has the following syntax:

----
neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation [-h] [--docker] [--expand-commands]
                                         [--verbose] [--additional-config=<file>]
                                         [--memory=<size>]
----

=== Description

The command prints heuristic memory settings recommendations for the Neo4j JVM heap and pagecache.
It either uses the total system memory or the amount of memory specified in the `--memory` argument.
The heuristic assumes that the system is dedicated to running Neo4j.
If this is not the case, then use the --memory argument to specify how much memory can be expected to be dedicated to Neo4j.
The output is formatted such that it can be copy-pasted into the _neo4j.conf_ file.

The argument `--docker` outputs environmental variables that can be passed to a Neo4j Docker container.
For a detailed example, see xref:docker/operations.adoc#docker-neo4j-memrec[Use Neo4j Admin for memory recommendations].

=== Options

The `neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation` command has the following options:

.`neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation` options
[options="header", cols="5m,6a,4m"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Default

|--additional-config=<file>
|Configuration file with additional configuration.
|

|--docker
|The recommended memory settings are produced in the form of environment variables that can be
directly passed to a Neo4j docker container. The recommended use is to save the generated
environment variables to a file and pass the file to a docker container using the `--env-file`
docker option.
|

|--expand-commands
|Allow command expansion in config value evaluation.
|

|-h, --help
|Show this help message and exit.
|

|--memory=<size>
|Recommend memory settings with respect to the given amount of memory, instead of the total memory of the system running the command. Valid units are: `k`, `K`, `m`, `M`, `g`, `G`.
|The memory capacity of the machine.

|--verbose
|Enable verbose output.
|

== Considerations

The `neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation` command calculates a valid starting point for the Neo4j memory settings, based on the provided memory.
The specific conditions for your use case may warrant adjustment of these values.
See xref:performance/memory-configuration.adoc[Memory configuration] for a description of the memory settings in Neo4j.

==  Example

.Use the `memory-recommendation` command of `neo4j-admin`
====
The following example illustrates how `neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation` provides a recommendation on how to use 16g of memory:

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin server memory-recommendation --memory=16g

...
...
...
# Based on the above, the following memory settings are recommended:
server.memory.heap.initial_size=5g
server.memory.heap.max_size=5g
server.memory.pagecache.size=7g
