[[neo4j-admin-migrate]]
= Migrate a database

You can use the `neo4j-admin database migrate` command to migrate a Neo4j database from one store format to another or to a later `MAJOR` version of the same format.

A store format defines how the data of a database is stored on the file system.

As of Neo4j 5, the store format of a database is versioned with the `MAJOR.MINOR` scheme, independent of Neo4j versioning.
An upgrade to the latest `MINOR` format version is an automatic operation performed on database startup.
A migration to a higher `MAJOR` format version or another format is a manual action performed with the `migrate` command.

The store format for new databases can be set with the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] configuration setting.

== Syntax

The `neo4j-admin database  migrate` has the following syntax:

----
neo4j-admin database migrate [-h] [--expand-commands]
                             [--force-btree-indexes-to-range]
                             [--verbose]
                             [--additional-config=<file>] [--pagecache=<size>]
                             [--to-format=standard|high_limit|aligned] <database>
----

[NOTE]
====
The `neo4j-admin database migrate` command is run only on a stopped database.
====

=== Parameters

.`neo4j-admin database migrate` parameters
[options="header", cols="1m,3a"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description

|<database>
|Name of the database to migrate. Can contain `\*` and `?` for globbing. Note that `*` and `?` have special meaning in some shells and might need to be escaped or used with quotes.
|===

=== Options

The `neo4j-admin database migrate` command has the following options:

.`neo4j-admin database migrate` options
[options="header", cols="5m,6a"]
|===
| Option
| Description

|--additional-config=<file>
|Configuration file with additional configuration.

|--expand-commands
|Allow command expansion in config value evaluation.

|--force-btree-indexes-to-range
|Special option for automatically turning all BTREE indexes/constraints into RANGE. Be aware that RANGE indexes are not always the optimal replacement of BTREEs and performance may be affected while the new indexes are populated. See the Neo4j v5 migration guide online for more information. The newly created indexes will be populated in the background on the first database start up following the migration and users should monitor the successful
completion of that process.
[NOTE]
BTREE indexes are not supported in Neo4j v5 and the `neo4j-admin database migrate` command will remove all BTREE indexes and BTREE index-backed constraints.
It is recommended to create valid replacements before migrating the database.
For more information, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-5/migration/planning/#_prepare_indexes[[Upgrade and Migration Guide -> Prepare indexes].

|-h, --help
|Show this help message and exit.

|--pagecache=<size>
|The size of the page cache to use for the migration process. The general rule is that values up to the size of the database proportionally increase performance.

|--to-format=standard\|high_limit\|aligned
|Name of the format to migrate the store to.
If the format is specified, the target database is migrated to the latest known combination of `MAJOR` and `MINOR` versions of the specified format.
If not specified, the tool migrates the target database to the latest known combination of `MAJOR` and `MINOR` versions of the current format.

|--verbose
|Enable verbose output.
|===

== Example

The following example migrates the `movies` database to the latest known combination of `MAJOR` and `MINOR` versions of the `high_limit` format:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
neo4j-admin database migrate --to-format=high_limit movies
----

.Example output
