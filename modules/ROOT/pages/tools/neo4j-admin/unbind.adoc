== Limitations

[[unbind-command-usage]]
== Usage

You can use the `neo4j-admin server unbind` command to remove the cluster state of a cluster server, turn a cluster server into a standalone server, or remove and archive the cluster state of a cluster server.

=== Remove the cluster state of a server

To remove the cluster state of a server, run the `neo4j-admin server unbind` command from the _<neo4j-home>_ folder of that server.
When restarted, an unbound server rejoins the cluster as a new server and has to be enabled using the `ENABLE SERVER` command.

[WARNING]
====
Note that the `unbind` command preserves all database stores on the server.
When the unbound server is restarted and enabled, it is seen as an entirely new server.
Therefore, there is no guarantee that the allocator will pick this server to host the same databases.
This may lead to having orphaned database stores on this server.
====

=== Turn a cluster member into a standalone server

To start the Neo4j server in single (standalone) mode after unbinding it from the cluster, verify that xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_initial.server.mode_constraint[`initial.server.mode_constraint`] is set to `NONE` in xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[The neo4j.conf file].

=== Archive cluster state

If something goes wrong and debugging is needed, you can archive the cluster state, from the _<neo4j-home>_ folder, run the `neo4j-admin server unbind` command with the arguments `--archive-cluster-state=true` and `--archive-path=<destination-folder>`:

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin server unbind --archive-path=/path/to/archive-folder --archive-cluster-state=true
----

The default resultant file is named:

[result]
----
unbound_cluster_state.<YYYYMMDDHH24MM>.zip
