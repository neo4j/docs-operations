= Query routing decisions
:description: This appendix describes in detail how queries are routed to databases for execution.


[[appendix-routing-decisions-introduction]]
== Introduction

A query that arrives at a Neo4j server, over the bolt protocol from a driver, undergoes _query routing_.
Query routing is the process of deciding with which Cypher executor (database) and at which physical location the query should be executed.

== Routing decision tree

Before the query is executed, these are the decisions taken during query routing:

Step 1: Determine the name of the target database::
   Pick the first of these that has a value:
. link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/use[Cypher `USE` clause]
** Note that link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/databases[administration commands]  implicitly have `USE system`.
. link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/drivers-apis/[Driver session database]
. xref:manage-databases/introduction.adoc#manage-databases-default[Home or default database]
Step 2: Reuse open transaction::
* If there is an already open transaction to the target database, local or remote, then proceed to step 6.
* If not, then proceed to step 3.
Step 3: Determine the type of the target database (execution context type)::
* If the target database is a database in this DBMS, then the context type is _Internal_.
* If the target database is the xref:fabric/introduction.adoc#fabric-fabric-concepts[Fabric virtual database], then the context type is _Fabric_.
** This also allows the query to target multiple databases.
* If the target database is a xref:fabric/introduction.adoc#fabric-fabric-concepts[Fabric graph], then the context type is _External_.
Step 4: Determine the location of execution::
* If context type is _Internal_, then ...
** if the URI scheme is `bolt://` (routing disabled), then location is _Local_.
** if transaction mode is `READ`, then location is _Local_.
** if transaction mode is `WRITE`, then ...
*** if the local member is the leader for the database, then location is _Local_.
*** if the another member is the leader for the database, then ...
**** if xref:clustering/internals.adoc#causal-clustering-routing[server-side routing] is xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_fabric.database.name[enabled], then location is _Remote_ (using the xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.routing.advertised_address[routing advertised address] of that member).
**** if not, then fail.
* If context type is _Fabric_, then location is _Local_ (for this part of the query).
* If context type is _External_, then location is _Remote_ (using the xref:fabric/configuration.adoc#fabric-important-settings[URI and database] given in the configuration).
Step 5: Open a transaction::
* If location is _Local_, then open a transaction to the database on this member.
* If location is _Remote_, then open a driver transaction to the database using the URI determined in step 4.
Step 6: Execute query::
* Execute the query in the open transaction.
