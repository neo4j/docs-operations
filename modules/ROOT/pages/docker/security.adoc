:description: This chapter describes security in Neo4j when running in a Docker container. 


[[docker-encryption]]
== Encryption

The Docker image can expose Neo4j's native TLS support.
To use your own key and certificate, provide an _/ssl_ volume with the key and certificate inside.
The files must be called _neo4j.key_ and _neo4j.cert_.
You must also publish port `7473` to access the HTTPS endpoint.

docker run --publish=7473:7473 --publish=7687:7687 --volume=$HOME/neo4j/ssl:/ssl neo4j:{neo4j-version}
