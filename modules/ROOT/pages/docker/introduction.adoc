:description: An introduction to how Neo4j runs in a Docker container.
[[docker-overview]]
= Introduction

Docker can be downloaded for macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems from https://www.docker.com/get-started.
DockerHub hosts an link:https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j[official Neo4j image] that provides a standard, ready-to-run package of Neo4j Community Edition and Enterprise Edition for a variety of versions.

[[docker-edition]]
== Neo4j editions

Tags are available for both Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
Version-specific Enterprise Edition tags have an `-enterprise` suffix, for example: `neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}-enterprise`.
Community Edition tags have no suffix, for example `neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}`.
The latest Neo4j Enterprise Edition release is available as `neo4j:enterprise`.

All supported tags can be found at https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/tags.


Neo4j Enterprise Edition license::
To use Neo4j Enterprise Edition, you must accept the license agreement by setting the environment variable `NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes`.

[[docker-image]]
== Using the Neo4j Docker image

You can start a Neo4j container by using the following command.
Note that this Neo4j container will not persist data between restarts and will have the default username/password.

[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker run \
    --restart always \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----

You can try out your Neo4j container by opening _http://localhost:7474/_ (the Neo4j's Browser interface) in a web browser. 
By default, Neo4j requires authentication and prompts you to log in with a username/password of `neo4j/neo4j` at the first connection.
You are then prompted to set a new password.

[NOTE]
====
The default minimum password length is 8 characters.
Use the `dbms.security.auth_minimum_password_length` configuration to change it.
====

The following sections provide more information about how to set an initial password, configure Neo4j to persist data between restarts, and use the Neo4j Docker image.

[[docker-auth]]
== Using `NEO4J_AUTH` to set an initial password

When using Neo4j in a Docker container, you can set the initial password for the container directly by specifying the `NEO4J_AUTH` in your run directive:

[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker run \
    --restart always \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your_password \
    neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----

[NOTE]
====
With no persistent storage for the databases, `NEO4J_ATUH` takes effect each time the container is recreated, even if you have changed the password.

However, with persistent storage for the databases, `NEO4J_AUTH` only takes effect on the initial startup.
It is ignored when the container is recreated and cannot override a changed password.
====

Alternatively, you can disable authentication by specifying `NEO4J_AUTH` to `none`:

[source, shell]
----
--env NEO4J_AUTH=none
----

Please note that there is currently no way to change the initial username from `neo4j`.

[[docker-volumes]]
== Persisting data using Volumes

The `--volume` option maps a local folder to the container, where you can persist data between restarts. 

[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker run \
    --restart always \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your_password \
    --volume=/path/to/your/data:/data \
    --volume=/path/to/your/logs:/logs \
    neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----

The folders that you want to mount must exist before starting Docker, otherwise, Neo4j will fail to start due to permissions errors.

[NOTE]
====
If you have mounted a _/data_ volume containing an existing database, setting `NEO4J_AUTH` will have no effect.
The Neo4j Docker service will start, but you will need a username and password already associated with the database to log in.
====

[[docker-user]]
== Running Neo4j as a non-root user

For security reasons, Neo4j runs as the `neo4j` user inside the container.
You can specify which user to run as by invoking docker with the `--user` argument.
For example, the following runs Neo4j as your current user:

[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker run \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----

== More useful Docker Run options

This table lists some of the options available:

.Options for `docker run`
[options="header",cols="m,a,m"]
|===
|Option |Description  |Example

|--name
|Name your container to avoid generic ID
|docker run --name myneo4j neo4j

|-p
|Specify which container port to expose
|docker run -p7687:7687 neo4j

|-d
|Detach container to run in background
|docker run -d neo4j

|-v
|Bind mount a volume
|docker run -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data neo4j

|--env
|Set config as environment variables for the Neo4j database
|docker run --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your_password

|--restart
|Control whether Neo4j containers start automatically when they exit, or when Docker restarts.
|docker run --restart always

|--help
|Output full list of `docker run` options
|docker run --help
|===

[NOTE]
====
The `--restart always` option sets the Neo4j container (and Neo4j) to restart automatically whenever the Docker daemon is restarted.

If you no longer want to have the container auto-start on machine boot, you can disable this setting using the flag `no`:

[source, shell]
----
docker update --restart=no <containerID>
----

For more information on Docker restart policies, see link:https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically[The official Docker documentation].
====

[[docker-offline-installation]]
== Offline installation of Neo4j Docker image

Docker provides the `docker save` command for downloading an image into a `.tar` package so that it can be used offline, or transferred to a machine without internet access.

This is an example command to save the `neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}` image to a `.tar` file:
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker save -o neo4j-{neo4j-version-exact}.tar neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----

To load a docker image from a `.tar` file created by `docker save`, use the `docker load` command.
For example:
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker load --input neo4j-{neo4j-version-exact}.tar
----

For complete instructions on using the `docker save` and `docker load` commands, refer to:

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/[The official `docker save` documentation].
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/[The official `docker load` documentation].
