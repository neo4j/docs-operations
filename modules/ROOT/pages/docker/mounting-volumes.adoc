:description: How to use persistent storage when using Neo4j in Docker.
[[docker-volumes]]
= Persisting data with Docker volumes

Docker containers are ephemeral.
When a container is stopped, any data written to it is lost.
Therefore, if you want to persist data when using Neo4j in Docker, you must mount storage to the container.
Storages also allow you to get data in and out of the container.

Storage can be mounted to a container in two ways:

* A folder on the host file system.
* A Docker volume -- a named storage location that is managed by Docker.

For instructions on _how_ to mount storage to a Docker container, refer to the official Docker documentation link:https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/[Bind mounts^] and link:https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/[Volumes^].

Neo4j provides several mount points for storage to simplify using Neo4j in Docker.
The following sections describe the mount points and how to use them.

[[docker-volumes-mount-points]]
== Neo4j mount points and permissions

The following table is a complete reference of the mount points recognized by the Neo4j Docker image, and file permissions.

All the listed mount points are *optional*.
Neo4j can run in Docker without any volumes mounted at all.
However, mounting storage to `/data` is considered essential for all but the most basic use cases.

[WARNING]
====
Running containerized Neo4j without a `/data` mount results in *unrecoverable data loss* if anything happens to the container.

[[docker-volumes-data]]
=== Mounting storage to `/data`

Neo4j inside Docker stores database files in the `/data` folder.
By mounting storage to `/data`, any data written to Neo4j will persist after the container is stopped.

Stopping the container and then restarting with the same folder mounted to `/data` starts a new containerized Neo4j instance with the same data.

[CAUTION]
====
If Neo4j could not properly close down, it may have left data in a bad state and is likely to fail on startup.
This is the same as if Neo4j is run outside a container and not closed properly.
====

.Two ways to mount storage to the `/data` mount point
====
.Mounting a folder to `/data`
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -it --rm \
   --volume $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
   neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----

.Creating a named volume and mounting it to `/data`
[source, shell, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
docker volume create neo4jdata # <1>
docker run -it --rm \
   --volume neo4jdata:/data \  # <2>
   neo4j:{neo4j-version-exact}
----
<1> Create a Docker volume named `neo4jdata`.
<2> Mount the volume name `neo4jdata` to `/data`.
====

[[docker-volumes-logs]]
=== Mounting storage to `/logs`

Neo4j logging output is written to files in the _/logs_ directory.
This directory is mounted as a _/logs_ volume.
By mounting storage to `/logs`, the log files become available outside the container. +

[TIP]
====
For more information about configuring Neo4j, see xref:docker/configuration.adoc[Configuration]. +
For more information about the Neo4j log files, see xref:monitoring/logging.adoc[Logging].
====


[[docker-volumes-file-permissions]]
== File permissions

For security reasons, by default, Neo4j runs as the `neo4j` user inside the container.
This user has user ID `7474`.
If `neo4j` needs read or write access to a mounted folder, but does not have it, the folder will be automatically re-owned to `7474`.

[NOTE]
====
This is a convenient feature, so you do not have to worry about the finer details of file permissions in Docker and can get started more easily.
It does however mean that mounted folders change ownership, and you may find you can no longer read your files without root access.
====

=== Docker `run` with `--user` flag

The `--user` flag to `docker run` forces Docker to run as the provided user.
In this situation, if that user does not have the required read or write access to any mounted folders, Neo4j will fail to start.
