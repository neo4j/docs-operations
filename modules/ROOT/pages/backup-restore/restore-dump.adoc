:description: This section describes how to restore a database dump in a live Neo4j deployment.
[[restore-dump]]
= Restore a database dump

A database dump can be loaded to a Neo4j instance using the `load` command of `neo4j-admin`.


[[restore-dump-command]]
== Command

The `neo4j-admin load`  command loads a database from an archive created with the xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc#offline-backup-command[`neo4j-admin dump`] command.
Alternatively, `neo4j-admin load` can accept dump from standard input, enabling it to accept input from `neo4j-admin dump` or another source.

The command can be run from an online or an offline Neo4j DBMS.

If you are replacing an existing database, you have to shut it down before running the command.
If you are not replacing an existing database, you must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the load operation finishes.

`neo4j-admin load` must be invoked as the `neo4j` user to ensure the appropriate file permissions.

[[restore-dump-example]]
== Example

The following is an example of how to load the dump of the `neo4j` database created in the section xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc#offline-backup-example[Back up an offline database], using the `neo4j-admin load` command.
When replacing an existing database, you have to shut it down before running the command.

[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin load --from=/dumps/neo4j/neo4j-<timestamp>.dump --database=neo4j --force
----

[NOTE]
====
Unless you are replacing an existing database, you must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the load operation finishes.
====

[NOTE]
====
When using the `load` command to seed a Causal Cluster, and a previous version of the database exists, you must delete it (using `DROP DATABASE`) first.
Alternatively, you can stop the Neo4j instance and unbind it from the cluster using `neo4j-admin unbind` to remove its cluster state data.
If you fail to DROP or unbind before loading the dump, that databaseâ€™s store files will be out of sync with its cluster state, potentially leading to logical corruptions.
For more information, see xref:clustering/seed.adoc#causal-clustering-seed-from-backups[Seed a cluster from a database backup (online)].
====

[NOTE]
====
`neo4j-admin load` cannot be applied to the xref:fabric/introduction.adoc#fabric-fabric-concepts[Fabric virtual database].
It must be run directly on the databases that are part of the Fabric setup.
