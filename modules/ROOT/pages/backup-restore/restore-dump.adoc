:description: This section describes how to restore a database dump in a live Neo4j deployment.
[[restore-dump]]
= Restore a database dump

A database dump can be loaded to a Neo4j instance using the `load` command of `neo4j-admin`.


[[restore-dump-command]]
== Command

The `neo4j-admin database load` command loads a database from an archive created with the xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc#offline-backup-command[`neo4j-admin database dump`] command.
Alternatively, `neo4j-admin database load` can accept a dump from standard input, enabling it to accept input from `neo4j-admin database dump` or another source.

The command can be run from an online or an offline Neo4j DBMS.

If you are replacing an existing database, you have to shut it down before running the command.
If you are not replacing an existing database, you must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the load operation finishes.

`neo4j-admin database load` must be invoked as the `neo4j` user to ensure the appropriate file permissions.


[[restore-dump-syntax]]
=== Syntax

[source,role=noheader]
----
neo4j-admin database load   [-h]
                            [--verbose]

                            [--info]
                            [--overwrite-destination[=true|false]]
                            [--from-path=<path> | --from-stdin]
                            [--additional-config=<file>]
                            <database>          
----

<database> -- Name of the database to load.
Can contain `*` and `?` for globbing.

[[restore-dump-example]]
== Example

The following is an example of how to load the dump of the `neo4j` database created in the section xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc#offline-backup-example[Back up an offline database], using the `neo4j-admin database load` command.
When replacing an existing database, you have to shut it down before running the command.

[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database load --from-path=/dumps/neo4j neo4j --overwrite-destination
----

[NOTE]
====
Unless you are replacing an existing database, you must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the load operation finishes.
====

[NOTE]
====
When using the `load` command to seed a cluster, and a previous version of the database exists, you must delete it (using `DROP DATABASE`) first.
Alternatively, you can stop the Neo4j instance and unbind it from the cluster using `neo4j-admin server unbind` to remove its cluster state data.
If you fail to DROP or unbind before loading the dump, that databaseâ€™s store files will be out of sync with its cluster state, potentially leading to logical corruptions.
For more information, see xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed[Seed a cluster].
====

[NOTE]
====
`neo4j-admin database load` cannot be applied to xref:composite-databases/introduction.adoc#composite-databases-concepts[composite databases].
It must be run directly on the databases that are part of a composite database.
