:description: This section describes how to restore a database dump in a live Neo4j deployment.
[[restore-dump]]
= Restore a database dump

The `neo4j-admin database load` command can be used to load a database from an archive created with the xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc#offline-backup-command[`neo4j-admin database dump`] command or a full backup artifact created by the xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database backup`] command from Neo4j Enterprise.

If you are replacing an existing database, you have to shut it down before running the command and use the `--overwrite-destination` option. +
label:enterprise-edition[] If you are not replacing an existing database, you must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the load operation finishes.

The command can be run from either an online or offline Neo4j DBMS, and it must be executed as the `neo4j` user to ensure the appropriate file permissions.

[[restore-dump-syntax]]
== Syntax

[source,role=noheader]
----
neo4j-admin database load [-h] [--expand-commands] [--info] [--verbose] [--overwrite-destination[=true|false]]
                          [--additional-config=<file>] [--from-path=<path> | --from-stdin] <database>
----

== Description

Load a database from an archive.
_<archive-path>_ must be a directory containing an archive(s).
Archive can be a database dump created with the dump command, or can be a full backup artifact created by the backup command from Neo4j Enterprise.
If neither `--from-path` or `--from-stdin` is supplied `server.directories.dumps.root` setting will be searched for the archive.
Existing databases can be replaced by specifying `--overwrite-destination`.
It is not possible to replace a database that is mounted in a running Neo4j server.
If `--info` is specified, then the database is not loaded, but information (i.e. file count, byte count, and format of load file) about the archive is printed instead.

== Parameters

.`neo4j-admin database load` parameters
[options="header", cols="5m,10a"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
|<database>
|Name of the database to load. Can contain * and ? for globbing. Note that * and ? have special meaning in some shells and might need to be escaped or used with quotes.
|===

== Options

.`neo4j-admin database load` options
[options="header", cols="5m,10a,2m"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Default

|--additional-config=<file>footnote:[See xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc#_configuration[Tools -> Configuration] for details.]
|Configuration file with additional configuration.
|

|--expand-commands
|Allow command expansion in config value evaluation.
|

|--from-path=<path>
|Path to directory containing archive(s).
It is possible to load databases from AWS S3 buckets, Google Cloud storage buckets, and Azure bucket using the appropriate URI as the path.
|

|--from-stdin
|Read archive from standard input.
|

|-h, --help
|Show this help message and exit.
|

|--info
|Print meta-data information about the archive file, instead of loading the contained database.
|

|--overwrite-destination[=true\|false]
|If an existing database should be replaced.
|false

|--verbose
|Enable verbose output.
|
|===

[NOTE]
====
The `--from-path=<path>` option can also load databases from AWS S3 buckets, Google Cloud storage buckets, and Azure buckets.

[[restore-dump-example]]
== Examples

The following are examples of how to load a dump of a database (_database.dump_) created in the section xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc#offline-backup-example[Back up an offline database], using the `neo4j-admin database load` command or a full backup artifact created by the xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc[Back up an online database] using the `neo4j-admin database backup` command.
When replacing an existing database, you have to shut it down before running the command.
The `--overwrite-destination` option is required because you are replacing an existing database.

If you are not replacing an existing database in Enterprise Edition, you must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the load operation finishes.

[NOTE]
====
When using the `load` command to seed a cluster, and a previous version of the database exists, you must delete it (using `DROP DATABASE`) first.
Alternatively, you can stop the Neo4j instance and unbind it from the cluster using `neo4j-admin server unbind` to remove its cluster state data.
If you fail to DROP or unbind before loading the dump, that databaseâ€™s store files will be out of sync with its cluster state, potentially leading to logical corruptions.
For more information, see xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed[Seed a cluster].
====

[NOTE]
====
`neo4j-admin database load` cannot be applied to xref:database-administration/composite-databases/concepts.adoc[Composite databases].
It must be run directly on the databases that are associated with that Composite database.

=== Load a dump from a local directory

You can load a dump from a local directory using the following command:

[source,shell, role="nocopy"]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database load --from-path=/full-path/data/dumps neo4j --overwrite-destination=true
----

You can use the same command to load the database from its full backup artifact:

[source,shell, role="nocopy"]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database load --from-path=/full-path/to/backups neo4j --overwrite-destination=true
----

The following example shows how to designate a specific archive for the `load` command.

[source,shell, role="nocopy"]
----
cat foo.dump | neo4j-admin database load --from-stdin mydatabase
----

[role=enterprise-edition]
[[load-dump-cloud-storage]]
=== Load a dump from a cloud storage

The following examples show how to load a database dump located in a cloud storage bucket using the `--from-path` option.
