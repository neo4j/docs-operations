= Restore a database backup

[[restore-backup-command]]
== Command

A database backup artifact (full or differential) can be restored within the same or to a later Neo4j version using the `restore` command of `neo4j-admin`.

Starting with Neo4j 5.20, you can load a **full** database backup artifact using the xref:backup-restore/restore-dump.adoc#restore-dump-command[`neo4j-admin database load`] command.
This functionality is available in the Community Edition.

[NOTE]
====
Restoring a database backup to a previous Neo4j version is not supported.
====

You must create the database (using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database) after the restore operation finishes, unless you are replacing an existing database.
`neo4j-admin database restore` must be invoked as the `neo4j` user to ensure the appropriate file permissions.
For more information, see xref:database-administration/standard-databases/create-databases.adoc[Create databases].

[NOTE]
====
If you are using CDC, make sure to create this new database with the same `txLogEnrichment` value and in your CDC application, handle the potential loss or corruption of CDC data, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cdc/{page-version}/backup-restore/[Change Data Capture Manual -> Restore backups and snapshots].
====

[NOTE]
====
When restoring a backup chain, the transaction log contained in the differential backup artifacts must first be replayed.
This recovery operation is resource-intensive and can be decoupled from the restore operation by using the xref:backup-restore/aggregate.adoc[aggregate] command.

[[restore-backup-syntax]]
=== Syntax

[source,role=noheader]
----
neo4j-admin database restore [-h] [--expand-commands]
                             [--verbose] [--overwrite-destination[=true|false]]
                             [--additional-config=<file>]
                             --from-path=<path>[,<path>...]
                             [--restore-until=<recovery-criteria>] [--temp-path=<path>]
                             [--to-path-data=<path>] [--to-path-txn=<path>]
                              [<database>]
----

=== Parameters

.`neo4j-admin database restore` parameters
[options="header", cols="1m,3a"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description

|[<database>]
|Name of the database after restore. Usage of this parameter is only allowed if the `--from-path` option points to a path to a single artifact.
|===


[[restore-backup-command-options]]
=== Options

.`neo4j-admin database restore` options
[options="header", cols="5m,6a,4m"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Default

|--additional-config=<file>
|Configuration file with additional configuration.
|

|--expand-commands
|Allow command expansion in config value evaluation.
|

|--from-path=<path>[,<path>...]
|A single path or a comma-separated list of paths pointing to a backup artifact file.
An artifact file can be 1) a full backup, in which case it is restored directly or, 2) a differential backup, in which case the command tries first to find in the folder a backup chain ending at that specific differential backup and then restores that chain.
|

|-h, --help
|Show this help message and exit.
|

|--overwrite-destination[=true\|false]
|If an existing database should be replaced.
[NOTE]
This option is not safe on a cluster since clusters have an additional state that would be inconsistent with the restored database. In a cluster, restore to a new database to avoid this problem.
|false

|--restore-until=<recovery-criteria>
| Differential backup artifacts contain transaction logs that can be replayed and applied to stores contained in full backup artifacts when restoring a backup chain.
The database applies logs until the recovery predicate is satisfied.
Currently supported predicates are: `<transactionID>` and `<timestamp>`.

- to restore a database up to a transaction ID, the required transaction predicate should look like `--restore-until=123`, where 123 is the provided transaction ID.
The restore recovers transaction logs up to, but not including, the transaction 123.

- to restore a database up to a specific date, the required date predicate should look like `--restore-until=2021-09-11 10:15:30`, where 2021-09-11 10:15:30 is a UTC date and time.
The restore recovers transactions that were committed before the provided timestamp.
|

| --to-path-data=<path>
|Base directory for databases.
Usage of this option is only allowed if the `--from-path` parameter points to exactly one directory.
|

|--to-path-txn=<path>
|Base directory for transaction logs.
Usage of this option is only allowed if the `--from-path` parameter points to exactly one directory.
|

|--temp-path=<path>
|Provide a path to a temporary empty directory for storing backup files until the command is completed. The files will be deleted once the command is finished.
|

|--verbose
|Enable verbose output.
|
|===

[NOTE]
====
The `--from-path=<path>` option can also load backups from AWS S3 buckets (from Neo4j 5.19) and Google Cloud storage buckets (from Neo4j 5.21).
For more information, see <<restore-cloud-storage>>.

[[restore-backup-example]]
== Examples

The following examples show how to inspect your backup directory and restore a database backup, created in the section xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc#online-backup-example[Back up an online database].
It is assumed that the backup artifacts (full and differential) are located in the _/path/to/mybackups_ directory.

=== Inspect the backup artifacts

Use the following command to inspect the backup directory:

[source, shell,role=nocopy noplay]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database backup --inspect-path=/path/to/mybackups
----

.Example output
[source, role="noheader"]
----
|                                                       FILE | DATABASE |                          DATABASE ID |                TIME |  FULL | COMPRESSED | LOWEST TX | HIGHEST TX |
| file:///path/to/mybackups/neo4j-2023-06-29T14-46-27.backup |    neo4j | c8368b24-55e2-474d-bb41-75657f5bfcde | 2023-06-29T13:46:27 |  true |       true |         1 |         11 |
| file:///path/to/mybackups/neo4j-2023-06-29T14-50-45.backup |    neo4j | c8368b24-55e2-474d-bb41-75657f5bfcde | 2023-06-29T13:50:45 | false |       true |        12 |         14 |
| file:///path/to/mybackups/neo4j-2023-06-29T14-51-33.backup |    neo4j | c8368b24-55e2-474d-bb41-75657f5bfcde | 2023-06-29T13:51:33 | false |       true |        15 |         18 |
----

The example output shows that the backup artifacts are part of a backup chain.
The first artifact is a full backup, and the other two are differential backups.
The `LOWEST TX` and `HIGHEST TX` columns show the transaction IDs of the first and the last transaction in the backup artifacts.
That means, if you restore `neo4j-2023-06-29T14-50-45.backup`, your database will have `14` as the last transaction ID.


=== Restore a database backup

The following examples assume that you want to restore your data in a new database, called `mydatabase`.
If you want to replace an existing database, you need to stop it first, and add the option `--overwrite-destination=true` to the restore command.

==== Restore a full backup

. Restore a database backup by running the following command:
+
[source, shell,role=nocopy noplay]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --from-path=/path/to/backups/neo4j-2023-05-05T11-26-38.backup mydatabase
----
+
The `--from-path=` argument must contain the path to the last backup of a chain, in this case, `neo4j-2023-06-29T14-51-33.backup`.
+
[TIP]
====
If you want to restore several databases at once, you must stop them first and then you can alter the command by specifying a comma-separated list of paths to backup artifacts, and remove the `<database>` parameter.
You should also skip the `CREATE DATABASE` step afterward if you are replacing an existing database.
====
. Create the new database using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database.
+
[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase
----

=== Restore data up to a specific date

To restore data up to a specific date, you need to pass the backup artifact that contains the data up to that date. +
This example assumes that you want to restore your data in a new database, called `mydatabase`.
If you want to replace an existing database, you need to stop it first, and add the option `--overwrite-destination=true` to the restore command.

. Restore from the backup that contains the data up to the desired date.
+
[source, shell,role=nocopy noplay]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --from-path=/path/to/mybackups/neo4j-2023-06-29T14-50-45.backup --restore-until="2023-06-29 13:50:45" mydatabase
----
+
The `--from-path=` argument must contain the path to either a full or a differential backup artifact.
The `--restore-until=` argument must contain a UTC date and time.
The restore recovers all transactions that were committed before the provided date and time.
+
[TIP]
====
If you want to restore several databases at once, you must stop them first and then you can alter the command by specifying a comma-separated list of paths to backup artifacts, and remove the `<database>` parameter.
You should also skip the `CREATE DATABASE` step afterward if you are replacing an existing database.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you know the transaction ID of the last transaction that was committed before the date you want to restore to, you can use the `--restore-until=` argument with the transaction ID instead of the date.
For example, `--restore-until=123`.
====
. Create the new database using `CREATE DATABASE` against the `system` database:
+
[source, cypher, role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
----

[[restore-cloud-storage]]
=== Restore a backup located in a cloud storage

The following examples show how to restore a database located in a cloud storage bucket using the `--from-path` option.

[.tabbed-example]
=====
[.include-with-AWS-S3]
======

include::partial$/aws-s3-overrides.adoc[]

include::partial$/aws-s3-credentials.adoc[]

. Run the `neo4j-admin database restore` command to restore the database located in your AWS S3 storage.
The example assumes that you have backup artifacts located in the `myBucket/myDirectory` folder in your bucket.
+
[source, shell,role=nocopy noplay]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --from-path=s3://myBucket/myDirectory/myBackup.backup mydatabase
----
======

[.include-with-Google-cloud-storage]
======

include::partial$/gcs-credentials.adoc[]

. Run the `neo4j-admin database restore` command to restore the database located in a given folder in your Google storage bucket.
The example assumes that you have backup artifacts located in the `myBucket/myDirectory` folder in your bucket.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --to-path=gs://myBucket/myDirectory/myBackup.backup mydatabase
----
======

[.include-with-Azure-cloud-storage]
======

include::partial$/azb-credentials.adoc[]

. Run the `neo4j-admin database restore` command to restore the database located in a given folder in your Azure blob storage container.
The example assumes that you have backup artifacts located in the `myStorageAccount/myContainer/myDirectory` folder.
+
[source,shell]
----

----
======
=====

=== Restore a database backup in a cluster

To restore a database backup in a cluster, designate one of the servers to be used as a seeder, and restore the database backup on that server.
Then, use that server to create the restored database on other servers in the cluster.
For more information, see xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed[Designated seeder].

=== Restore users and roles metadata

If you have backed up a database with the option `--include-metadata`, you can manually restore the users and roles metadata.

From the _<NEO4J_HOME>_ directory, you run the Cypher script _data/scripts/databasename/restore_metadata.cypher_, which the `neo4j-admin database restore` command outputs, using xref:tools/cypher-shell.adoc[Cypher Shell]:

*Using `cat` (UNIX)*
[source, shell, role=nocopy noplay]
----
cat data/scripts/databasename/restore_metadata.cypher | bin/cypher-shell -u user -p password -a ip_address:port -d system --param "database => 'databasename'"
----

*Using `type` (Windows)*
[source, shell, role=nocopy noplay]
----
type data\scripts\databasename\restore_metadata.cypher | bin\cypher-shell.bat -u user -p password -a ip_address:port -d system --param "database => 'databasename'"
----
