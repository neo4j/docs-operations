:description: This section describes the backup modes.
[[backup-modes]]
= Backup modes

The backup client can operate in two different modes â€“ a _full backup_ and an _incremental backup_.

[[full-backup]]
== Full backup

A full backup is always required initially for the very first backup into a target location.

[NOTE]
====
The full backup can be run against both an *online* (using `neo4j-admin backup`) and an *offline* (using `neo4j-admin dump`) database.

[TIP]
====
For more information about performing a full backup against an *offline* database, see xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc[Back up an offline database].
====

[[incremental-backup]]
== Incremental backup


After the initial full backup, the subsequent backups attempt to use the incremental mode, where just the delta of the transaction logs since the last backup are transferred and applied onto the target location.
If the required transaction logs are not available on the backup server, then the backup client falls back on performing a full backup instead, unless `--fallback-to-full` is disabled.

[NOTE]
====
The incremental backup can be run only against an *online* database.
