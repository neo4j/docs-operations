:description: This section describes the backup modes.
[[backup-modes]]
= Backup modes

The backup client can operate in two different modes â€“ a _full backup_ and an _differential backup_.

[[full-backup]]
== Full backup

A full backup is always required initially for the very first backup into a target location.

[NOTE]
====
The full backup can be run against both an *online* (using `neo4j-admin database backup`) and an *offline* (using `neo4j-admin database dump`) database.

[NOTE]
====
A full online database backup creates a xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc#backup-artifact[full backup artifact] in the target location (`--to-path`).
====

For more information about performing a full backup against an *offline* database, see xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc[Back up an offline database].


[[differential-backup]]
== Differential backup


In the online backup version, after the initial full backup, the subsequent backups attempt to use the differential mode, where just the delta of the transaction logs since the last backup are transferred and used to create a differential backup artifact (stored in the target location). Those differential backup artifacts form a xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc#backup-chain[backup chain].
If the required transaction logs are not available on the backup server, then the backup client falls back on performing a full backup instead.
