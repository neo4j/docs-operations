= Back up an offline database

[CAUTION]
====
Remember to xref:backup-restore/planning.adoc[plan your backup] carefully and back up each of your databases, including the `system` database.

[[offline-backup-command]]
== Command

The `neo4j-admin database dump` command can be used for performing a full backup of an **offline** database.
It dumps a database into a single-file archive, called _<database>.dump_, and stores it in the xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc#data[_<NEO4J_HOME>/data_] directory.
Alternatively, `neo4j-admin database dump` can stream dump to standard output, enabling the output to be piped to another program, for example to `neo4j-admin database load`.

If the database is hosted in a cluster, make sure that the database is stopped on the server you are connected to.
The command can be run only locally from an online or an offline Neo4j DBMS.
It does not support SSL/TLS.

[[offline-command-syntax]]
=== Syntax

[source,role=noheader]
----
neo4j-admin database dump [-h] [--expand-commands]
                          [--verbose] [--overwrite-destination[=true|false]]
                          [--additional-config=<file>]
                          [--to-path=<path> | --to-stdout]
                          <database>
----

=== Description

Dump a database into a single-file archive.
The archive can be used by the load command.
`<to-path>` should be a directory (in which case a file called _<database>.dump_ will be created), or `--to-stdout` can be supplied to use standard output.
If neither `--to-path` or `--to-stdout` is supplied `server.directories.dumps.root` setting will be used as a destination.
It is not possible to dump a database that is mounted in a running Neo4j server.
