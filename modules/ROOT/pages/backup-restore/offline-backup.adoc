= Back up an offline database

[CAUTION]
====
Remember to xref:backup-restore/planning.adoc[plan your backup] carefully and to back up each of your databases, including the `system` database.
====


[[offline-backup-command]]
== Command

A Neo4j database can be backed up in offline mode using the `dump` command of `neo4j-admin`.
If the database is hosted in a cluster, make sure that the database is stopped on the server you are connected to.


[[offline-backup-command-usage]]
=== Usage

The `neo4j-admin database dump` command can be used for performing a full backup of an **offline** database.
It dumps a database into a single-file archive, called _<database>.dump_.
Alternatively, `neo4j-admin database dump` can stream dump to standard output, enabling the output to be piped to another program, for example to `neo4j-admin database load`.

The command can be run only locally from an online or an offline Neo4j DBMS.

It does not support SSL/TLS.


[[offline-command-syntax]]
=== Syntax

[source,role=noheader]
----
neo4j-admin database dump [-h] [--expand-commands]
                          [--verbose] [--overwrite-destination[=true|false]]
                          [--additional-config=<file>]
                          [--to-path=<path> | --to-stdout]
                          <database>
----

=== Description

Dump a database into a single-file archive.
The archive can be used by the load command.
`<to-path>` should be a directory (in which case a file called _<database>.dump_ will be created), or `--to-stdout` can be supplied to use standard output.
If neither `--to-path` or `--to-stdout` is supplied `server.directories.dumps.root` setting will be used as a destination.
It is not possible to dump a database that is mounted in a running Neo4j server.

[[offline-backup-example]]
== Example

The following is an example of how to create a dump of the default database `neo4j` using the `neo4j-admin database dump` command.
The target directory _/dumps/neo4j_ must exist before running the command and the database must be offline.

[source, shell, role="nocopy"]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database dump <database> --to-path=/full/path/to/dumps/
----

The command creates a file called _<database>.dump_ where `<database>` is the database specified in the command.

[NOTE]
====
`neo4j-admin database dump` cannot be applied to xref:composite-databases/index.adoc[Composite databases].
It must be run directly on the databases that are associated with that Composite database.
