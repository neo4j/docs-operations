= Back up an offline database

[CAUTION]
====
Remember to xref:backup-restore/planning.adoc[plan your backup] carefully and to back up each of your databases, including the `system` database.
====


[[offline-backup-command]]
== Command

A Neo4j database can be backed up in offline mode using the `dump` command of `neo4j-admin`.
If the database is hosted in a cluster, make sure that the database is stopped on the server you are connected to.


[[offline-backup-command-usage]]
=== Usage

The `neo4j-admin database dump` command can be used for performing a full backup of an **offline** database.
It dumps a database into a single-file archive, called _<database>.dump_.
Alternatively, `neo4j-admin database dump` can stream dump to standard output, enabling the output to be piped to another program, for example to `neo4j-admin database load`.

The command can be run only locally from an online or an offline Neo4j DBMS.

It does not support SSL/TLS.

The following is an example of how to create a dump of the default database `neo4j` using the `neo4j-admin database dump` command.
The target directory _/dumps/neo4j_ must exist before running the command and the database must be offline.

[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database dump neo4j --to-path=/dumps/neo4j

It must be run directly on the databases that are part of a composite database.
