= Single instances (VM-based)
:description: This chapter describes how to launch a single instance from an image on GCP. 


== Prerequisites

* You know how to run and operate Neo4j locally.
* You know how to access cloud-hosted Neo4j from your application. See the https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/4.0/[Driver Manual^].
* You have https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install[installed and set up Google Cloud SDK^] to be able to use the `gcloud` command-line tool.
* You have https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing[authenticated your gcloud CLI^], to interact with your GCP projects.


[[single-instance-gcp-create-a-firewall-rule]]
== Create a firewall rule to access your instance

Create a firewall rule to be able to access your instance when it is launched:

[source, gcloud command, subs="attributes+,+specialchars,+macros", role="noheader"]
----
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-neo4j-bolt-http-https \ <1>
  --allow tcp:7473,tcp:7474,tcp:7687 \ <2>
  --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 \ <3>
  --target-tags neo4j <4>
----

<1> Create a firewall rule with the name `allow-neo4j-bolt-http-https`.
<2> Allow traffic on ports:
+
* `7473` (HTTPS, for Neo4j Browser and HTTP API).
* `7474` (HTTP, for Neo4j Browser and HTTP API).
* `7687` (Bolt Protocol).
+
<3> The ranges, provided with the `--source-ranges` argument, allow the entire Internet to contact your new instance.
<4> The `--target-tags` argument specifies that this rule applies only to VMs tagged with `neo4j`. +
When you launch your instance, you have to apply that tag to it.


[[single-instance-gcp-create-a-compute-instance]]
== Create a Google compute instance from the Neo4j public image

. List all available Neo4j public images.
+
The images are published in a GCP project called `launcher-public`, so by listing images in that project, you can see what is available.
+
.`launcher-public` images
[source, gcloud command, role="noheader"]
----
gcloud compute images list --project launcher-public
----
+
.`launcher-public` images -- filtered on Neo4j 4.X versions
[source, gcloud command, role="noheader"]
----
gcloud compute images list --project launcher-public | grep --extended-regexp "neo4j-(community|enterprise)-1-4-.*"
----
+
For example, the image `neo4j-enterprise-1-4-2-2-apoc` includes Neo4j Enterprise 4.2.2 with the APOC plugin.
+
. Create a new instance.
+
You create and launch an instance by using the following `gcloud` commands:
+
[source, gcloud command, subs="attributes+,+specialchars,+macros", role="noheader"]
----
gcloud config set project <project-id> <1>
gcloud compute instances create my-neo4j-instance --image-project launcher-public \ <2>
  --image <neo4j-image-name> \ <3>
  --tags neo4j <4>
----
+
<1> Set your project configuration to ensure you know where you are launching your instance.
<2> Launch an image found in the provided public project `launcher-public`.
<3> Replace `<neo4j-image-name>` with the image name you want to launch.
<4> The `--tags` argument allows you to configure the correct network permissions. +
By default, Google blocks all external access to the network services unless you open them.
+
. Note the `EXTERNAL_IP`.
+
When the launch is successful, you get the following result:
+
.Example output
[source, output example, role="noheader"]
----
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/testbed-187316/zones/us-east1-b/instances/my-neo4j-instance].
NAME               ZONE             MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
my-neo4j-instance  europe-north1-a  n1-standard-1               192.0.2.0    203.0.113.0     RUNNING
----
+
Note the IP addressfootnote:[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737] in the `EXTERNAL_IP` column, this is for the Neo4j server.

[TIP]
====
The `gcloud` tool comes with many command-line options.
For more details on how to deal with machine type, memory, available storage, etc., consult https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create[the Google Cloud documentation^].
====


[[single-instance-gcp-access-neo4j]]
== Access your new instance

Navigate to `http://[EXTERNAL_IP]:7474/browser` or `https://[EXTERNAL_IP]:7473/browser`, log in with the default username `neo4j` and password `neo4j`, and change the password, when prompted.

[NOTE]
====
Neo4j 3.X versions include a self-signed certificate for TLS.
Because you do not have a hostname or a valid SSL certificate configured by default, your browser will warn you that the certificate is not trusted.

Neo4j 4.X versions do not include any certificate for TLS.
You can configure the certificate later.
====


[[single-instance-gcp-access-compute-instance-ssh]]
== Access your instance via SSH

You can run the following command to SSH into the instance:

.ssh
[source, gcloud command, role="noheader"]
----
gcloud compute ssh my-neo4j-instance
----

Inside the VM, you can check the status of the `neo4j` service:

.systemctl
[source, shell command, role="noheader"]
----
sudo systemctl status neo4j
----

[source, example output, role="noheader"]
----

For details on internals of Google VMs, including how to stop and start system services, configure Neo4j from the VM, etc., consult xref:cloud-deployments/cloudVms.adoc[Neo4j cloud VMs].


[[single-instance-gcp-delete-compute-instance]]
== Delete your instance

You can run the following command to delete your instance:

[source, gcloud command, role="nohead"]
----
gcloud compute instances delete my-neo4j-instance
----
