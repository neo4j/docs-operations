:description: Deploy Neo4j on Amazon Web Services (AWS) directly from the AWS Marketplace or by using the Neo4j CloudFormation templates hosted on GitHub.

= Neo4j on AWS

You can deploy Neo4j on AWS directly from the link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-akmzjikgawgn4[AWS Marketplace].
Neo4j provides Amazon CloudFormation templates for Neo4j Enterprise standalone and Neo4j cluster.
They are public, and you can find them at https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j.
The Neo4j AWS Marketplace listing uses the link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/main/marketplace/neo4j.template.yaml[marketplace] template to deploy Neo4j.
It can set up Neo4j DBMS, Graph Data Science, and Bloom.

== Neo4j CloudFormation template

CloudFormation is a recipe that tells AWS how to deploy a whole set of interrelated resources.

The Neo4j CloudFormation templates have the following properties:

* Deploying one or three EC2 VMs in a specified region.
* Deploying EC2 VMs in multiple availability zones within a region so that your entire DBMS does not go down if one goes down.
* Deploying a new virtual private cloud (VPC) and installing Neo4j in it.
This way, you can control network access by tuning your VPC and security rules.


== Deploy Neo4j Enterprise (standalone or cluster)

To deploy a Neo4j Enterprise standalone or a Neo4j cluster, create a CloudFormation stack by launching the Neo4j CloudFormation template in AWS.

. Log in to the https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS management console].
. In the search field, look for _marketplace_ and select *AWS Marketplace Subscriptions*. +
. Navigate to *AWS Marketplace* -> *Discover products* and search for Neo4j.
. From the list, click *Neo4j Enterprise Edition*.
. Click the *Continue to Subscribe* button. +
You need a subscription to be able to launch Neo4j on AWS.
. Click the *Continue to Configuration* button. +
The window *Configure this software* opens.
The default configurations launch the latest version of Neo4j.
. Click the *Continue to Launch* button.
The window *Launch this software* opens.
. From the *Choose Action* dropdown menu, select *Launch CloudFormation* to load the Neo4j CloudFormation template, and click *Launch*.
. Fill in the following information to configure your Neo4j deployment:
.. The *Create stack* window specifies the template you are going to use.
Here, you do not need to do anything.

.. The *Specify stack details* window contains various parameters that control your Neo4j and infrastructure:
* *Stack name* - the name of your stack.
* (Optional) Parameters for installing GDS or Bloom.
* *Password* - password for Neo4j.
* *Node Count* - the number of Neo4j instances.
If you want to launch a standalone, select 1, and if you are going to launch a cluster, select 3.
* *Instance Type* - the AWS instance type you want to launch, which controls your database capacity.
* *Disk Size* - the size in GB of EBS volume on each instance node.
The default is 100.
* *SSH CIDR* - the address range from which EC2 instances are accessible on port `22`.
You can set it to `0.0.0.0/0` to allow any IP on the internet to contact your instance(s).
If you want to lock it down to just your companyâ€™s IP block, this is where you must specify that.

.. (Optional) On the *Configure stack options* window, you can specify tags to apply to the resources in your stack, stack permissions, as well as some advanced options.
.. On the *Review <stack-name>* window, review the stack configurations that you have selected.
If you are happy with them, tick *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*.
+

..  Click the button *Create stack*. +
The CloudFormation stack will deploy AWS resources for your Neo4j DBMS.

== Verify that Neo4j is up

When the CloudFormation stack is created, navigate to the *Outputs* tab and click the *Neo4jLoadBalancerURL*.

== Clean up the resources and remove your stack

Select the CloudFormation stack you want to remove and click the *Delete* button.
The stack deletion cleans up all AWS resources deployed by it.
