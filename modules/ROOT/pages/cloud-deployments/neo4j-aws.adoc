= Neo4j on AWS

You can deploy Neo4j on Amazon Web Services (AWS) directly from the AWS Marketplace or by using the Neo4j CloudFormation templates hosted on GitHub.

The AWS Marketplace represents a straightforward method to deploy Neo4j on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in AWS.

The Neo4j Enterprise Edition listings (for both Neo4j 5 and 4.4) on the AWS Marketplace can be found at link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-akmzjikgawgn4[Neo4j Enterprise Edition on the AWS Marketplace].


In addition to the AWS Marketplace listings, Neo4j provides several CloudFormation templates, which can be customized to meet more complex use cases.
These templates are hosted in a public GitHub repository and can be found at link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j[Neo4j CloudFormation templates on GitHub].

Further custom templates, which serve other commonly requested use cases, can be on the same repository in the link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/main/custom-templates[custom-templates] directory.  
These custom templates are also freely available but are not part of the Neo4j official AWS Marketplace offering. 

[TIP]
====
The link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j[main] branch hosts the CodeFormation templates for Neo4j 5.  
A link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/4.4[separate] branch is maintained for the templates for Neo4j 4.4.

The official Neo4j AWS Marketplace listing uses the link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/main/marketplace/neo4j.template.yaml[marketplace] template to deploy Neo4j.
