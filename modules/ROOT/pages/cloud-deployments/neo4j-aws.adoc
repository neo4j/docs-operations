= Neo4j on AWS

You can deploy Neo4j Enterprise Edition on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in AWS directly from the link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-akmzjikgawgn4?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[AWS Marketplace].

The AWS Marketplace listing uses the https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/main/marketplace/neo4j.template.yaml[Neo4j CloudFormation template] (hosted in the https://github.com/neo4j-partners/[neo4j-partners] public GitHub repository), which can be customized to meet more complex use cases.

CloudFormation templates for Neo4j v4.4 are also supported (they can be found in the https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/Neo4j-4.4/marketplace[Neo4j-4.4 branch of the same repository]), along some custom templates that serve other commonly requested use cases.

[NOTE]
====
Note that Neo4j does not provide AMIs with a pre-installed version of the product.
The Neo4j Marketplace listings and custom listings on Github leverage CloudFormation templates and user-data scripting to deploy Neo4j.

== Neo4j CloudFormation template

AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that tells AWS how to deploy a set of interrelated resources.

The Neo4j CloudFormation templates have the following properties:

* Optionally install Graph Data Science (GDS). Customers can also provide a license key for GDS.

* Optionally install Bloom. Customers can also provide a license key for Bloom.

* Specify the number of desired Neo4j instances.

* Select the EC2 instance type and disk size.

* Specify SSH CIDR range.  This field must also be correctly populated to allow the use of ec2 instance-connect.

== Verify that Neo4j is running

When the CloudFormation stack is created, navigate to the *Outputs* tab and click the *Neo4jLoadBalancerURL*.

== Clean up the resources and remove your stack

Select the CloudFormation stack to be removed and click the *Delete* button.
The stack deletion cleans up all AWS resources deployed by it.
