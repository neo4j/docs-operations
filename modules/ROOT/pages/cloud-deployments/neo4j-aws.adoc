= Neo4j on AWS

Neo4j can be easily deployed on EC2 instances in Amazon Web Services (AWS) by using the link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-akmzjikgawgn4?sr=0-2&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[official listing for Neo4j Enterprise Edition] on the AWS Marketplace.

The AWS Marketplace listing uses a CloudFormation template maintained by Neo4j, which can be customized to meet more complex or bespoke use cases.
See <<neo4j-cloudformation-template>> for more information about the Neo4j CloudFormation template.

[NOTE]
====
Neo4j does not provide Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with a pre-installed version of the product.
The Neo4j AWS Marketplace listings (and listings on GitHub) use CloudFormation templates that deploy and configure Neo4j dynamically with a shell script.
====

== Supported Neo4j versions

The Neo4j link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=23ec694a-d2af-4641-b4d3-b7201ab2f5f9[AWS marketplace listing] can be configured to deploy either Neo4j Enterprise Edition 2025.x or 5.26 LTS.
The  CloudFormation template always installs the latest available version.

== Neo4j CloudFormation template

AWS CloudFormation is a declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) language that is based on YAML and instructs AWS to deploy a set of cloud resources.

The Neo4j CloudFormation template's code is available on link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/blob/main/marketplace/neo4j-enterprise/neo4j.template.yaml[GitHub].
It takes several parameters as inputs, deploys a set of cloud resources, and provides outputs that can be used to connect to a Neo4j DBMS.

=== Important considerations

* The deployment of cloud resources incurs costs.
Refer to the link:https://calculator.aws[AWS pricing calculator] for more information.

* The Neo4j CloudFormation template deploys a new VPC.
** AWS accounts are limited to an initial quota of 5 VPCs (you can view your current quota on the *Limits* page of the Amazon EC2 console).
** Your VPC quota can be increased if needed by contacting AWS support.

* The Neo4j CloudFormation template uses an Auto Scaling group (ASG) to deploy EC2 instances.
This means that to stop or terminate EC2 instances, you must first remove them from the ASG, otherwise, the ASG will automatically replace them.

* SSH Keys are not generated as part of the CloudFormation template.
Use EC2 Instance Connect (via the EC2 console) to connect to deployed EC2 instances if needed.

=== Deployed cloud resources

The environment created by the CloudFormation template consists of the following AWS resources:

* 1 VPC, with a CIDR range (address space) of `10.0.0.0/16`.
* 3 Subnets (if a cluster has been selected), distributed evenly across 3 Availability zones, with the following CIDR ranges:
** `10.0.1.0/24`
** `10.0.2.0/24`
** `10.0.3.0/24`
* A single subnet (if a single instance has been selected) with the following CIDR range:
** `10.0.1.0/24`
* An internal and external security group.
* An internet gateway.
* Routing tables (and associations) for all subnets.
* Neo4j http and bolt listeners and rules in the security group to allow inbound traffic on ports `7474` and `7687`.
* An auto-scaling group and launch configuration, which creates 1, or between 3 and 10 EC2 instances (Depending on whether a single instance or an autonomous cluster is selected).
* 1 Network (Layer 4) Load Balancer.
* A target group for the EC2 instances.

== Neo4j cluster on AWS

=== Cluster version consistency

When the CloudFormation template creates a new Neo4j cluster, an Auto Scaling group (ASG) is created and tagged with the monthly version of the installed Neo4j database.
If you add more EC2 instances to your ASG, they will be installed with the same monthly version, ensuring that all Neo4j cluster servers are installed with the same version, regardless of when the EC2 instances were created.


=== Neo4j cluster and Auto Scaling Group

The Neo4j AWS CloudFormation template deploys a cluster into an ASG.
However, managing a Neo4j cluster with ASG requires careful planning.
Neo4j’s clustering relies on stable servers identities.
In contrast, ASGs are primarily designed for stateless, interchangeable workloads, which means they can terminate and recreate servers at any time, breaking their identity.

To provide stable servers identities, it is recommended to use a persistent disk, e.g., Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS).
For more information about EBS volumes, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volumes.html[Amazon EBS volumes].
Amazon EBS provides block storage resources that can be used with Amazon EC2 instances.

If a server in Neo4j cluster does not remount its original EBS volume, it will either:

* Start with no data (store copy issue).
* Fail to rejoin the cluster correctly.

How to run Neo4j cluster in EC2 instances with ASGs::
+
. Create an EBS volume and tag it.
You can follow the steps outlined in the guide link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-creating-volume.html[Create an Amazon EBS volume].
+
. Attach the EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone.
For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-attaching-volume.html[Attach an Amazon EBS volume to an Amazon EC2 instance].
+
. Ensure stable volume re-attachment.
Use an instance startup script (via EC2 User data or `systemd` service) to:
.. Identify its own logical identity (e.g., via private IP or hostname).
.. Locate the correct EBS volume by tag.
.. Attach the volume to the instance.
.. Mount the volume to `/var/lib/neo4j` or appropriate data directory.
+
. Use rolling updates only.
Set `maxSurge = 0` and `maxUnavailable = 1` in any update mechanism to avoid multiple restarts that could destabilize the cluster.
+
. Avoid auto-healing on cluster members.
ASG health checks should not terminate cluster members automatically.
Use external monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Neo4j’s health checks) and manual intervention for cluster members.



=== Remove a server from the Neo4j cluster

Rolling updates on Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) often involve rotating the images.
However, simply removing Neo4j servers from the target Network Load Balancer (NLB) one by one does not prevent requests from being routed to them.
This occurs because the NLB and Neo4j server-side routing operate independently and do not share awareness of a server availability.

To correctly remove a server from the cluster and reintroduce it after the update, follow the steps outlined below:

. Remove the server from the AWS NLB.
 This prevents external clients from sending requests to the server.

. Since Neo4j's cluster routing (server-side routing) does not use the NLB, you need to ensure that queries are not routed to the server.
To do this, you have to cleanly shut down the server.

.. Run the following query to check servers are hosting all their assigned databases.
The query should return no results:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW SERVERS YIELD name, hosting, requestedHosting, serverId WHERE requestedHosting <> hosting
----

.. Use the following query to check all databases are in their expected state.
The query should return no results:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, address, currentStatus, requestedStatus, statusMessage WHERE currentStatus <> requestedStatus RETURN name, address, currentStatus, requestedStatus, statusMessage
----

.. To stop the Neo4j service, run the following command:
+
[source, shell, role=copy]
----
sudo systemctl stop neo4j
----
+
To configure the timeout period for waiting on active transactions to either complete or be terminated before the shutdown, modify the setting xref::configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.shutdown_transaction_end_timeout[`db.shutdown_transaction_end_timeout`] in the _neo4j.conf_ file.
`db.shutdown_transaction_end_timeout` defaults to 10 seconds.
+
The environment variable `NEO4J_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` determines how long the system will wait for Neo4j to stop before forcefully terminating the process.
You can change this using `systemctl edit neo4j.service`.
By default, `NEO4J_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` is set to 120 seconds.
If the shutdown process exceeds this limit, it is considered failed.
You may need to increase the value if the system serves long-running transactions.

.. Verify that the shutdown process has finished successfully by checking the _neo4j.log_ for relevant log messages confirming the shutdown.


. When everything is updated or fixed, start the servers one by one again.
.. Run `systemctl start neo4j`.
.. Once the server has been restarted, confirm it is running successfully.
+
Run the following command and check the server has state `Enabled` and health `Available`.
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW SERVERS WHERE name = [server-id];
----

.. Confirm that the server has started all the databases that it should.
+
This command shows any databases that are not in their expected state:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, address, currentStatus, requestedStatus, serverID WHERE currentStatus <> requestedStatus AND serverID = [server-id] RETURN name, address, currentStatus, requestedStatus
----

. Reattach the server to the NLB.
Once the server is stable and caught up, add it back to the AWS NLB target group.


== Licensing

Installing and starting Neo4j from the AWS marketplace constitutes an acceptance of the Neo4j license agreement.
When deploying Neo4j, users are required to confirm that they either have an enterprise license or accept the terms of the Neo4j evaluation license.

If you require the Enterprise version of either Graph Data Science or Bloom, you need to provide a key issued by Neo4j as this will be required during the installation.

To obtain a valid license for either Neo4j, Bloom, or GDS, reach out to your Neo4j account representative or get in touch using the link:https://neo4j.com/contact-us/[contact form].
