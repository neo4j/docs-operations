You can deploy Neo4j Enterprise Edition on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in AWS directly from the link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-akmzjikgawgn4?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[AWS Marketplace].

The listing uses the https://github.com/neo4j-partners/amazon-cloud-formation-neo4j/tree/main/marketplace/neo4j.template.yaml[Neo4j CloudFormation template] (hosted in a public GitHub repository), which can be customized to meet more complex use cases.

CloudFormation templates for Neo4j v4.4 are also supported, as well as some custom templates that serve other commonly requested use cases.

[NOTE]
====
Note that Neo4j does not provide AMIs with a pre-installed version of the product.
The Neo4j Marketplace listings and custom listings on Github leverage CloudFormation templates and user-data scripting to deploy Neo4j.
