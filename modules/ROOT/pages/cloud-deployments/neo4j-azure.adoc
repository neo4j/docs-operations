= Neo4j on Azure

You can deploy a Neo4j standalone server or a cluster on Azure directly from the Azure Marketplace or by using the Neo4j Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template hosted on GitHub.

The Azure Marketplace represents a straightforward method to deploy Neo4j on a VM instance in Azure.

The Neo4j Enterprise Edition v4.4 can be deployed from the link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neo4j.neo4j-ee[Neo4j Enterprise Edition listing on the Azure Marketplace].

In addition to the Azure Marketplace listing, Neo4j provides an ARM template, which can be customized to meet more complex use cases.
This template is hosted in a public GitHub repository and can be found at link:https://github.com/neo4j-partners/azure-resource-manager-neo4j[Neo4j ARM template on GitHub].


== Neo4j ARM template

ARM is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that tells Azure how to deploy a set of interrelated resources.

The Neo4j ARM template has the following properties:

* **Virtual Machine Size:** Select the VM size for the machine(s) that will host your deployment.

* **Graph Database Version:** The Neo4j version to be installed (in this case, 4.4).

* (Cluster only) **Virtual Machine Size for Read Replicas:** Select the VM size for the read replica servers in your cluster.

* **Node Count:** Specify the number of desired servers depending on whether you want to deploy a standalone or a cluster.

* **Disk Size:** The disk size for a Neo4j server.

* (Cluster only) **Read Replica Count:** Specify the number of desired servers depending on whether you want to deploy a standalone or a cluster.

* (Cluster only) **Read Replica Disk Size:** The disk size for a Neo4j read replica server.

* Optionally install Graph Data Science (GDS).
It requires a license key to be provided.

* Optionally install Bloom.
It requires a license key to be provided.

== Deploy Neo4j from the Azure Marketplace

Deploy a Neo4j Enterprise cluster from the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neo4j.neo4j-ee[Azure Marketplace] following the interactive prompts.

It is recommended to create a new resource group to hold the artifacts of your deployment.

[NOTE]
====
At the end of the deployment process, Azure runs a validation.
If the validation fails, it might be because you have chosen VMs that are too large and exceed your Azure quota.

== Verify that Neo4j is running

When the Neo4j deployment completes, navigate to the *Outputs* tab and copy the Neo4j Browser URL.

== Clean up the resources and remove your deployment

You can remove the infrastructure by deleting the resource group you created as part of the deployment.
