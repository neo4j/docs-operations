:description: How to configure network connectors (Bolt, HTTP, and HTTPS) for Neo4j.
[[connectors]]
= Configure network connectors

Neo4j provides support for Bolt, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols using network connectors.
Network connectors are configured in the _neo4j.conf_ file.

[[connectors-available-connectors]]
== Available network connectors

The table below lists the available network connectors in Neo4j:

.Neo4j network connectors and port number
[options="header"]
|===
| Network connector name  | Protocol | Default port number
| `server.bolt`   | Bolt     | `7687`
| `server.http`   | HTTP     | `7474`
| `server.https`  | HTTPS    | `7473`
|===

When configuring the HTTPS or Bolt connectors, see also xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc[SSL framework] for details on how to work with SSL certificates.


[[connectors-configuration-options]]
== Configuration options

The network connectors are configured by settings in the format `server.<network-connector-name>.<setting-suffix>>`.

.Configuration option suffixes for network connectors
[options="header",cols="15,25,60,60"]
|===
| Option name
| Default
| Setting(s)
| Description

| `enabled`
| `true` footnote:[When Neo4j is used in embedded mode, the default value is `false`.]
| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.bolt.enabled[server.bolt.enabled]`, `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.http.enabled[server.http.enabled]`, `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.https.enabled[server.https.enabled]` footnote:[The default value for `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.https.enabled[server.https.enabled]` is `false`.]
| This setting allows the client connector to be enabled or disabled.
  When disabled, Neo4j does not listen for incoming connections on the relevant port.

| `listen_address`
| `localhost:<network-connector-default-port>`
| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.bolt.listen_address[server.bolt.listen_address]`, `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.https.listen_address[server.https.listen_address]`, `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.http.listen_address[server.http.listen_address]`
| This setting specifies how Neo4j listens for incoming connections.
It consists of two parts; an IP address (e.g. 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0) and a port number (e.g. 7687), and is expressed in the format `<ip-address>:<port-number>`.
See below for an example of usage.

| `advertised_address`
| `localhost:<network-connector-default-port>`
| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.bolt.advertised_address[server.bolt.advertised_address]`, `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.https.advertised_address[server.https.advertised_address]`, `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.http.advertised_address[server.http.advertised_address]`
| This setting specifies the address that clients should use for this network connector.
This is useful in a cluster as it allows each server to correctly advertise the addresses of the other servers in the cluster.
The advertised address consists of two parts; an address (fully qualified domain name, hostname, or IP address) and a port number (e.g. 7687), and is expressed in the format `<address>:<port-number>`.
See below for an example of usage.

| `tls_level`
| `DISABLED`
| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.bolt.tls_level[server.bolt.tls_level]`
| This setting is only applicable to the Bolt connector.
It allows the Bolt connector to accept encrypted and/or unencrypted connections.
The default value is `DISABLED`, where only unencrypted client connections are to be accepted by this connector, and all encrypted connections will be rejected.

Other values are `REQUIRED` and `OPTIONAL`.
Use `REQUIRED` when only encrypted client connections are to be accepted by this connector, and all unencrypted connections will be rejected.
Use `OPTIONAL` where either encrypted or unencrypted client connections are accepted by this connector.
|===

.Specify `listen_address` for the Bolt connector
====
To listen for Bolt connections on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and on port 7000, set the `listen_address` for the Bolt connector:
----
server.bolt.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7000
----
====

.Specify `advertised_address` for the Bolt connector
====
If routing traffic via a proxy, or if port mappings are in use, it is possible to specify `advertised_address` for each network connector individually.
For example, if port `7687` on the Neo4j server is mapped from port `9000` on the external network, specify the `advertised_address` for the Bolt connector:
----
server.bolt.advertised_address=<server-name>:9000
----
====


[[connectors-options-for-bolt-thread-pooling]]
== Options for Bolt thread pooling

See xref:performance/bolt-thread-pool-configuration.adoc[Bolt thread pool configuration] to learn more about Bolt thread pooling and how to configure it on the network connector level.

[[connectors-defaults-for-addresses]]
== Defaults for addresses

It is possible to specify defaults for the configuration options with `listen_address` and `advertised_address` suffixes.
Setting a default value applies to all network connectors unless specifically configured for a certain connector.


`xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.default_listen_address[server.default_listen_address]`::
This configuration option defines a default IP address of the settings with the `listen_address` suffix for all network connectors.
If the IP address part of the `listen_address` is not specified, it is inherited from the shared setting `server.default_listen_address`.
+
.Specify `listen_address` for the Bolt connector
====

To listen for Bolt connections on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and on port 7000, set the `listen_address` for the Bolt connector:
----
server.bolt.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7000
----

This is equivalent to specifying the IP address by using the `server.default_listen_address` setting, and then specifying the port number for the Bolt connector.
----
server.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0

server.bolt.listen_address=:7000
----
====

`xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.default_advertised_address[server.default_advertised_address]`::
This configuration option defines a default address of the settings with the `advertised_address` suffix for all network connectors.
If the address part of the `advertised_address` is not specified, it is inherited from the shared setting `server.default_advertised_address`.
+
.Specify `advertised_address` for the Bolt connector
====

Specify the address that clients should use for the Bolt connector:

----
server.bolt.advertised_address=server1:9000
----

This is equivalent to specifying the address by using the `server.default_advertised_address` setting, and then specifying the port number for the Bolt connector.
----
server.default_advertised_address=server1

server.bolt.advertised_address=:9000
----

====

[WARNING]
====
The default address settings can only accept the hostname or IP address portion of the full socket address.
Port numbers are protocol-specific, and can only be added by the protocol-specific network connector configuration.

For example, if you configure the default address value to be `example.com:9999`, Neo4j will fail to start and you will get an error in xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc[_neo4j.log_].
