:description: Introduction of the _neo4j.conf_ file, syntax, and configuration settings.
[[neo4j-conf]]
= The neo4j.conf file

The _neo4j.conf_ file is the main source of configuration settings in Neo4j and includes the mappings of configuration setting keys to values.
The location of the _neo4j.conf_ file in the different configurations of Neo4j is listed in xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc#table-file-locations[Default file locations].

Most of the configuration settings in the _neo4j.conf_ file apply directly to Neo4j itself, but there are also other settings related to the Java Runtime (the JVM) on which Neo4j runs.
For more information, see the xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc#neo4j-conf-JVM[JVM specific configuration settings].
Many of the configuration settings are also used by `neo4j` launcher scripts.


[[neo4j-conf-syntax]]
== `neo4j.conf` conventions

The syntax in the `neo4j.conf` file follows the following conventions:

* The equals sign (`=`) maps configuration setting keys to configuration values.
* Lines that start with the number sign (`#`) are handled as comments.
* Trailing comments are not supported.
* Empty lines are ignored.
* Configuring a setting in _neo4j.conf_ overwrites any default values.
If you want to amend the default values with custom ones, you must explicitly list the default values along with the new ones.
* The configuration settings are not ordered.
* The configuration settings have strict validation enabled by default.
It prevents Neo4j from starting if the _neo4j.conf_ file contains _typos_, _incorrect information_, or _duplicates_ (except for `server.jvm.additional`).
If you set more than one value for xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.jvm.additional[`server.jvm.additional`], each setting value adds another custom JVM argument to the `java` launcher.
+
To disable the strict validation, set `server.config.strict_validation.enabled=false`.
* By default, the character encoding is assumed to be ISO 8859-1.
From Neo4j 4.8 onwards, this can be overridden by setting the environment variable `NEO4J_CONFIG_FILE_CHARSET` to, for example, `utf8`.


== Configuration settings

=== General synopsis

Neo4j configuration settings have the following general synopsis:

`<prefix>.<scope>.<component>....<component>.<name>`

Prefix::
Prefixes are reserved for denoting two special cases (most settings do not have a prefix):
+
* `initial` -- Settings that are only used during the initialization but are ignored thereafter.
For example, `initial.server.mode_constraint`, `initial.dbms.default_database`, etc.
* `internal` -- The prefix replaces the terms `unsupported` and `experimental` used in previous versions.
This namespace is dedicated to features that are used internally and may change without notice.

Scope::
All configuration settings fall into one of the following scopes that behave differently:
+
* `db` settings can be varied between each database but must be consistent across all configuration files in a cluster/DBMS.
* `dbms` settings must be consistent across all configuration files in a cluster/DBMS.
* `server` settings apply only to the specific server and can be varied between configuration files across a cluster/DBMS.
* `browser` settings apply only to Neo4j Browser.
* `client` settings apply only to the client.
+
[NOTE]
====
In Neo4j 5, the `fabric` scope is no longer available.
All configuration settings identified by the `fabric` namespace in the `neo4j.conf` file are moved into the `system` database.
The Cypher surface is extended to support the Fabric configuration.

For more information, see xref:database-administration/composite-databases/manage-composite-databases.adoc[Composite databases].
====
Component::
Component namespaces are used to group settings that affect similar systems.

Name::
The name of the setting.
It may contain a common verb and unit patterns, such as `size`, `enabled`, etc.
Words are separated by an underscore.

[[neo4j-conf-JVM]]
=== JVM-specific configuration settings

A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs and programs written in other languages that are also compiled in Java bytecode.
The Java heap is where the objects of a Java program live.
Depending on the JVM implementation, the JVM heap size often determines how and for how long time the virtual machine performs xref:performance/gc-tuning.adoc[garbage collection].

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description

| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.memory.heap.initial_size[server.memory.heap.initial_size]`
| Sets the initial heap size for the JVM.
By default, the JVM heap size is calculated based on the available system resources.

| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.memory.heap.max_size[server.memory.heap.max_size]`
| Sets the maximum size of the heap for the JVM.
By default, the maximum JVM heap size is calculated based on the available system resources.

| `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.jvm.additional[server.jvm.additional]`
| Sets additional options for the JVM.
The options are set as a string and can vary depending on JVM implementation.
|===

[NOTE]
====
If you want to have good control of the system behavior, it is recommended to set the heap size parameters to the same value to avoid unwanted full garbage collection pauses.

[[neo4j-conf-current-settings]]
=== List currently active settings

You can use `SHOW SETTINGS` to list the currently active configuration settings and their values.
