[[file-locations-file-locations]]
== Customize your file locations
The file locations can also be customized by using environment variables and options.

The locations of _<neo4j-home>_ and _conf_ can be configured using environment variables:

[[table-file-locations-environment-variables]]
.Configuration of _<neo4j-home>_ and _conf_
[cols="4", options="header"]
|===
| Location
| Default
| Environment variable
| Notes

| _<neo4j-home>_
| parent of _bin_
| `NEO4J_HOME`
| Must be set explicitly if _bin_ is not a subdirectory.

| _conf_
| _<neo4j-home>/conf_
| `NEO4J_CONF`
| Must be set explicitly if it is not a subdirectory of _<neo4j-home>_.
|===

The rest of the locations can be configured by uncommenting the respective setting in the _conf/neo4j.conf_ file and changing the default value.

[[file-locations-permissions]]
== File permissions

The operating system user that Neo4j server runs as must have the following minimal permissions:

Read only::
  * _bin_
  * _certificates_
  * _conf_
  * _import_
  * _labs_
  * _lib_
  * _licenses_
  * _plugins_
  * _products_

Read and write::
  * _data_
  * _logs_
  * _metrics_
  * _run_

Execute::
  * all files in _bin_ and _tmp_

[NOTE]
====
If  _tmp_ is set to `noexec`, it is recommended to set `dbms.jvm.additional=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/home/neo4j` in _conf/neo4j.conf_.
Additionally, replace _/home/neo4j_ with a path that has `exec` permissions.

For _/bin/cypher-shell_, set this via an environment variable: `export JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/home/neo4j` and replace `/home/neo4j` with a path that has `exec` permissions.
