:description: An overview of where files are stored in the different Neo4j distributions, and the necessary file permissions for running Neo4j.

[[file-locations]]
= Default file locations

[[neo4j-directories]]
== Neo4j directories

The overview of the Neo4j folders:

* Bin -- The Neo4j running script and built-in tools, such as xref:tools/cypher-shell.adoc[Cypher Shell] and xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc[Neo4j Admin].
* Certificates -- The Neo4j TLS certificates.
* Configuration -- The Neo4j configuration settings, Log4j configuration settings, and the JMX access credentials.
For details about _neo4j.conf_, see xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[The neo4j.conf file].
* Data -- All data-related content, such as databases, transactions, cluster-state (if applicable), dumps, and the _cypher.script_ files (from the `neo4j-admin database restore` command).
The data directory is internal to Neo4j and its structure is subject to change between versions without notice.
* Import -- All CSV files that the command `LOAD CSV` uses as sources to import data in Neo4j.
* Labs -- Contains APOC Core.
For more information, see https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/installation/[APOC User Guide -> Installation].
* Lib -- All Neo4j dependencies.
* Licenses -- For storing license files from Neo4j.
* Logs -- The Neo4j log files.
* Metrics -- The Neo4j built-in metrics for monitoring the Neo4j DBMS and each individual database.
* Plugins -- Custom code that extends Neo4j, for example, user-defined procedures, functions, and security plugins.
* Products -- The jar files of the Neo4j products: Graph Data Science Library and Bloom. The folder also contains a _README.txt_ file with information on enabling them.
* Run -- The processes IDs.

The following tables list the default locations of the Neo4j files per distribution.

Instructions provided for Neo4j Desktop are applicable across all operating systems where Neo4j Desktop is supported.

[NOTE]
====
If  _tmp_ is set to `noexec`, it is recommended to set `dbms.jvm.additional=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/home/neo4j` in _conf/neo4j.conf_.
Additionally, replace _/home/neo4j_ with a path that has `exec` permissions.

For _/bin/cypher-shell_, set this via an environment variable: `export JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/home/neo4j` and replace `/home/neo4j` with a path that has `exec` permissions.

[[file-locations-file-locations]]
== Customize your file locations
The file locations can also be customized by using environment variables and options.

The locations of _<neo4j-home>_ and _conf_ can be configured using environment variables:

[[table-file-locations-environment-variables]]
.Configuration of _<neo4j-home>_ and _conf_
[cols="4", options="header"]
|===
| Location
| Default
| Environment variable
| Notes

| _<neo4j-home>_
| parent of _bin_
| `NEO4J_HOME`
| Must be set explicitly if _bin_ is not a subdirectory.

| _conf_
| _<neo4j-home>/conf_
| `NEO4J_CONF`
| Must be set explicitly if it is not a subdirectory of _<neo4j-home>_.
|===


The rest of the locations can be configured by uncommenting the respective setting in the _conf/neo4j.conf_ file and changing the default value.
