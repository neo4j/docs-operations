:description: How to set an initial password for Neo4j.
[[post-installation-set-initial-password]]
= Set an initial password

Use the `set-initial-password` command of `neo4j-admin` to define the password for the native user `neo4j`.
This must be performed before starting up the database for the first time.

If the password is not set explicitly using this method, it will be set to the default password `neo4j`.
In that case, you will be prompted to change the default password at first login.



[NOTE]
====
The default minimum password length is 8 characters.

Use the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_config_dbms.security.auth_minimum_password_length[`dbms.security.auth_minimum_password_length`] configuration setting to change the default minimum value.
