:description: This section describes how to set an initial password for Neo4j. 

Use the `set-initial-password` command of `neo4j-admin` to define the password for the native user `neo4j`.
This must be performed before starting up the database for the first time.

*Syntax:*

`neo4j-admin set-initial-password <password>`

.Use the `set-initial-password` command of neo4j-admin
====

Set the password for the native `neo4j` user to 'h6u4%kr' before starting the database for the first time.
----
$neo4j-home> bin/neo4j-admin set-initial-password h6u4%kr
----
====

If the password is not set explicitly using this method, it will be set to the default password `neo4j`.
In that case, you will be prompted to change the default password at first login.
