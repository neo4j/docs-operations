:description: This page describes how to load plugins to a Neo4j deployment.

Neo4j Enterprise Edition comes bundled with a range of pre-installed products, such as Graph Data Science library and Bloom, which can be used to extend the Neo4j capabilities.
The JAR files for these products are located in the _products_ folder and can be installed as plugins.

Neo4j Community Edition comes with the APOC plugin only in the _labs_ directory.

If you want to use your own plugins, ensure that you add them to the designated _plugins_ directory.
This directory serves as the central location where Neo4j looks for and loads the plugins at startup.

[NOTE]
====
Bloom Enterprise and GDS Enterprise require a license activation key.
Reach out to your Neo4j account representative or request a representative to link:https://neo4j.com/contact-us/#sales-inquiry[contact you].

== Install and configure plugins

Here are the steps to enable the plugins:

. Move or copy the plugins (_.jar files_) from _<NEO4J_HOME>/products_ and _<NEO4J_HOME>/labs_ to the _<NEO4J_HOME>/plugins_ directory.
See xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc[Default file locations] for more information.

. Add the following lines in _<NEO4J_HOME>/conf/neo4j.conf_:
+
[source, properties]
----
# to enable GDS:

* dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
* dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
* gds.enterprise.license_file=/path/to/my/license/keyfile


#  to enable Bloom:

* dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=bloom.*
* dbms.bloom.license_file=/path/to/my/license/keyfile


#  to enable both GDS and Bloom:

* dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*,bloom.*
* dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
* gds.enterprise.license_file=/path/to/my/license/keyfile
* dbms.bloom.license_file=/path/to/my/license/keyfile
----
. Install the plugins.

Refer to link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current/bloom-installation/[Bloom documentation], link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/[GDS documentation] for more details on how to install them.

[NOTE]
====
All installed plugins will automatically be loaded every time Neo4j is started.
Because of that, the number of plugins may impact the startup time.
Install only the necessary plugins to avoid performance issues.
