:description: How to configure Neo4j to use FIPS compatible SSL encryption.
:keywords: ssl, tls, authentication, encryption, encrypted, security, fips, fips 140, fips 140-2, nist, hipaa

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140 is a U.S. government standard established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which is used to accredit cryptographic modules such as those used in TLS network encryption.
While FIPS 140 compliance is primarily required for federal agencies and their contractors, it also is used in the healthcare sector under regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to protect patient data.

This guide helps configure Neo4j to use TLS/SSL encryption in a FIPS-compliant way.
It is supplementary to the xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc[] documentation, as many of the configuration processes and requirements are the same.


[[ssl-fips-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* Verify that the machine running Neo4j has FIPS-compatible hardware and operating system.
Only xref:installation/requirements.adoc#deployment-requirements-software[Linux operating systems] are supported for Neo4j FIPS compatibility at this time.
* Use Neo4j Enterprise 5.23.0 or later.
* Install and configure a non-native authentication provider, for example LDAP or SSO. See xref:authentication-authorization/index.adoc[].


[[fips-ssl-provider-docker]]
== Enable FIPS SSL provider (Docker)

The Neo4j RedHat UBI9 Docker image comes with the SSL provider and dependencies pre-installed, but it is not enabled by default.

[NOTE]
====
The Debian based Neo4j Docker image does *not* support FIPS compatible encryption.
====

To enable the OpenSSL FIPS provider, set the environment variable `NEO4J_OPENSSL_FIPS_ENABLE=true` when starting the container.

[[fips-ssl-provider]]
== Enable FIPS SSL provider

[IMPORTANT]
====
Skip this section if using Neo4j in Docker.
====

The secure networking in Neo4j is provided through the Netty library, which supports both the native JDK SSL provider and Netty-supported OpenSSL derivatives.
Specifically Netty's _Forked Tomcat Native_ library called https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative[netty-tcnative].

The `netty-tcnative` library is provided in several variants.
However, to achieve FIPS compliance, you must use the dynamically linked version of `netty-tcnative` alongside a FIPS-compatible installation of OpenSSL.

The dynamically linked library requires the following dependencies to be installedfootnote:[https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html]:

* Apache Portable Runtime Library
* A FIPS certified version of OpenSSL, with a FIPS provider installed and set as default.

Refer to https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html[Forked Tomcat Native] for more information.


[NOTE]
====
Netty provides a convenient pre-build, statically linked version of `netty-tcnative` using BoringSSL, but this is not FIPS certifiedfootnote:[https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/master/crypto/fipsmodule/FIPS.md].

By using the dynamic `netty-tcnative` library variant combined with a FIPS certified OpenSSL installation, Neo4j's cryptographic operations are delegated by `netty-tcnative` to OpenSSL, transitively giving FIPS compatibility.
====

[[install-apr]]
=== Install Apache portable runtime library

To install https://apr.apache.org[Apache Portable Runtime Library], use the operating system's package manager.

In Debian/Ubuntu this package is usually called `libapr1`
[source, console, subs="attributes"]
.Install Apache Portable Runtime Library in Debian or Ubuntu
----
apt install -y libapr1
----

In RedHat Enterprise Linux, the package is usually called `apr`:

[source, console, subs="attributes"]
.Install Apache Portable Runtime Library in RedHat
----
dnf install -y apr
----

[[install-openssl]]
=== Install OpenSSL

Instructions on how to build and install a FIPS-compatible OpenSSL are out of scope for this document. Installation steps can differ depending on operating system, and other security requirements you might have for OpenSSL.

In general:

* For a list of FIPS certified OpenSSL versions, see https://openssl-library.org/source/[].
* A FIPS provider must be installed into OpenSSL.
* OpenSSL must be configured to use the FIPS provider by default.



[[install-netty-tcnative-lib]]
=== Install the correct `netty-tcnative` library

Since Neo4j 5.23.0, builds of `netty-tcnative` dynamic library are provided in the Neo4j `lib` directory under their own subfolder called `netty-tcnative`.

To install the `netty-tcnative` dynamic library:

. Locate the Neo4j `lib` directory.
+
The location of the `lib` directory is different depending on the method used to install Neo4j.
Check the xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc#neo4j-lib[file locations] documentation for the correct location.
+
This location will be referred to as _<NEO4J_LIB>_.
. Make sure there are no `netty-tcnative-boringssl` libraries present in the _<NEO4J_LIB>_ folder.
+
[source, console]
----
find <NEO4J_LIB> -name "netty-tcnative-boringssl*.jar" -delete
----
+
. Check which netty-tcnative libraries are available:
+
[source, console]
----
ls -l <NEO4J_LIB>/netty-tcnative
----
There are Linux and Fedora Linux variants available, compiled for both x86_64 and ARM 64 architectures.
Select the one matching the local machine's operating system and architecture.
+
. Verify the dependencies are correctly installed using https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html[`ldd`]:
+
[source, console]
.Verify netty-tcnative dependencies are installed
----
unzip -d /tmp <NEO4J_LIB>/netty-tcnative/netty-tcnative-*-linux-$(arch).jar
ldd /tmp/META-INF/native/libnetty_tcnative_linux_*.so
rm -rf /tmp/META-INF
----
+
[source, console]
.Verify Fedora variant of netty-tcnative dependencies are installed
----
unzip -d /tmp <NEO4J_LIB>/netty-tcnative/netty-tcnative-*-linux-$(arch)-fedora.jar
ldd /tmp/META-INF/native/libnetty_tcnative_linux_$(arch).so
rm -rf /tmp/META-INF
----
The `ldd` command shows a list of library dependencies and where they are loaded from on the local machine.
** If any dependencies are missing, they must be installed, or Neo4j will fail to run.
** The `libssl.so` and `libcrypto.so` libraries listed must be the ones installed with OpenSSL in the previous steps.
+
. Copy the verified JAR file to _<NEO4J_LIB>_.
+
[NOTE]
====
Only copy *one* of the JAR files. Otherwise Neo4j will not be able to resolve dependencies at runtime.
In case of this error, you will get a message like:
[source]
----
"Failed to load any of the given libraries: [netty_tcnative_linux_x86_64, netty_tcnative_linux_x86_64_fedora, netty_tcnative_x86_64, netty_tcnative]".

[[generate-ssl-cert-private-key]]
== Generate SSL certificate and private key

Neo4j SSL encryption requires a xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc#term-ssl-certificate[certificate] in the xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc#term-ssl-x509[X.509] standard and a private key in xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc#term-ssl-pkcs8[PKCS #8] format, both encoded in PEM format.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For FIPS compatibility, the private key must be secured with a password.
====

Refer to the xref:security/ssl-framework.adoc#ssl-certificates[SSL certificate and key instructions] for more information.
