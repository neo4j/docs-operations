= System requirements and configuration

== System requirements

The sharded property database requires the same xref:installation/requirements.adoc[system requirements] as Neo4j 2025.10 and later versions.

== Configuration settings

To enable the property sharding in your cluster, you must also ensure that the default Cypher version is set to Cypher 25 by adding `db.query.default_language=CYPHER_25` parameter to the `neo4j.conf` file on each server or by prefixing your Cypher queries with `CYPHER_25`.
See xref:configuration/cypher-version-configuration.adoc[Configure the Cypher default version] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/queries/select-version/[Cypher Manual -> Select Cypher version].
