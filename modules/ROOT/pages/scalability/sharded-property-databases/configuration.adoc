To enable the property sharding in your cluster, you must configure the following additional configuration settings on each server:

| Configuration setting | Description

| internal.dbms.sharded_property_database.enabled=true
| By default, the sharded property database is disabled. This setting is a feature toggle behind which the sharded property database is developed.
See xref:scalability/sharded-property-databases/overview.adoc[Property sharding overview].

| db.query.default_language=CYPHER_25
| Ensures that any database created will use Cypher 25 (unless users specifically override the default version in the `CREATE DATABASE` command).
See xref:configuration/cypher-version-configuration.adoc[Configure the Cypher default version] and link:   shttps://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/25/queries/select-version/[Cypher Manual -> Select Cypher version].

| internal.dbms.cluster.experimental_protocol_version.dbms_enabled=true
| Allows users to take valid backups of a sharded database.
