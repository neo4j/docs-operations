= Starting and stopping sharded property databases

You can start and stop a sharded database using  `START DATABASE <name>` and `STOP DATABASE <name>`.

If the name is equal to the sharded database name, the graph shard and all its property shards are started/stopped.
If the name is equal to a shard name, only the specified shard is stopped.

[WARNING]
====
Stopping a single shard makes the database inaccessible.
Therefore, this should only be done if you need to perform some action that requires only one shard to be offline, such as the recovery of a single shard.

Please, do not do this unless you know what you are doing.
