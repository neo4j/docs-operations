:description: Managing role-based access control in sharded property databases.
= Role-based access control (RBAC)

Role-based access control works as on a standard database.
For details, see xref:authentication-authorization/manage-privileges.adoc[Role-based access control].

However, privileges are granted on the virtual database.
Explicitly granting privileges on a shard is not supported.

The following example shows how to `GRANT MATCH` privileges on the sharded database:

[source, cypher]
----
GRANT MATCH { prop } ON GRAPH `foo-sharded` NODES A TO reader
----

[NOTE]
====
Property-based access control is not supported.
