:check-mark: icon:check[]

A subset of this functionality is also available in Community Edition.
The table below includes an indication of which functions this is valid for.
Refer to xref:deprecated-security-procedures/community-edition.adoc[Community Edition] for a complete description.

In Neo4j, native user and role management are managed by using built-in procedures through Cypher.
This section gives a list of all the security procedures for user management along with some simple examples.
Use Neo4j Browser or Neo4j Cypher Shell to run the examples provided.

The following table lists the available procedures:

[[userauth-activate-user]]
== Activate a suspended user

An administrator is able to activate a suspended user so that the user is once again able to access the data in their original capacity.

*Syntax:*

`CALL dbms.security.activateUser(_username_, _requirePasswordChange_)`

*Arguments:*

[options="header"]
|===
| Name                  | Type      | Description
| `username`              | String  | This is the username of the user to be activated.
| `requirePasswordChange` | Boolean | This is optional, with a default of `true`. If this is `true`, (i) the user will be forced to change their password when they next log in, and (ii) until the user has changed their password, they will be forbidden from performing any other operation.
|===

*Exceptions:*

|===
| The current user is not an administrator.
| The username does not exist in the system.
| The username matches that of the current user (i.e. activating the current user is not permitted).
|===

*Considerations:*

|===
| This is an idempotent procedure.
|===


.Activate a suspended user
====
The following example activates a user with the username '*jackgreen*'.
When the user '*jackgreen*' next logs in, he will be required to xref:deprecated-security-procedures/enterprise-edition.adoc#userauth-change-your-password[change his password].

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.security.activateUser('jackgreen')
----
====


[[user-roles-assign-role-to-user]]
== Assign a role to the user

An administrator is able to assign a role to any user in the system,
thus allowing the user to perform a series of actions upon the data.

*Syntax:*

`CALL dbms.security.addRoleToUser(_roleName_, _username_)`

*Arguments:*

[options="header"]
|===
| Name                  | Type      | Description
| `roleName`            | String    | This is the name of the role to be assigned to the user.
| `username`            | String    | This is the username of the user who is to be assigned the role.
|===

*Exceptions:*

|===
| The current user is not an administrator.
| The username does not exist in the system.
| The username contains characters other than alphanumeric characters and the ‘_’ character.
| The role name does not exist in the system.
| The role name contains characters other than alphanumeric characters and the ‘_’ character.
|===

*Considerations:*

|===
| This is an idempotent procedure.
|===

.Assign a role to the user
====
The following example assigns the role `publisher` to the user with username '*johnsmith*'.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.security.addRoleToUser('publisher', 'johnsmith')
----
====


[[userauth-change-your-password]]
== Change the current user's password

[CAUTION]
The procedure `dbms.security.changePassword(newPassword, requirePasswordChange)` has been entirely removed since the corresponding Cypher administration command also requires the old password, and thus is more secure.
Please use `ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD FROM 'oldPassword' TO 'newPassword'`, documented in the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/access-control/manage-users/#access-control-alter-password[Cypher Manual], instead.

[[userauth-change-users-password]]
== Change the given user's password

An administrator is able to change the password of any user within the system.
Alternatively, the current user may change their own password.

*Syntax:*

`CALL dbms.security.changeUserPassword(_username_, _newPassword_, _requirePasswordChange_)`

*Arguments:*

[options="header"]
|===
| Name          | Type   | Description
| `username`    | String | This is the username of the user whose password is to be changed.
| `newPassword` | String | This is the new password for the user.
| `requirePasswordChange` | Boolean | This is optional, with a default of `true`. If this is `true`, (i) the user will be forced to change their password when they next log in, and (ii) until the user has changed their password, they will be forbidden from performing any other operation.
|===

*Exceptions:*

|===
| The current user is not an administrator and the username does not match that of the current user.
| The username does not exist in the system.
| The password is the empty string.
| The password is the same as the user's previous password.
|===

*Considerations:*

|===
| This procedure may be invoked by the current user to change their own password, irrespective of whether or not the current user is an administrator.
| This procedure may be invoked by an administrator to change another user's password.
| In addition to changing the user's password, this will terminate with immediate effect all of the user's sessions and roll back any running transactions.
|===

.Change a given user's password
====
The following example changes the password of the user with the username '*joebloggs*' to '*h6u4%kr*'.
When the user '*joebloggs*' next logs in, he will be required to xref:deprecated-security-procedures/enterprise-edition.adoc#userauth-change-your-password[change his password].

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.security.createRole('operator')
----
====


[[userauth-add-user]]
== Create a new user

This action ought to be followed by assigning a role to the user, which is described xref:deprecated-security-procedures/enterprise-edition.adoc#user-roles-assign-role-to-user[here].

*Syntax:*

`CALL dbms.security.createUser(_username_, _password_, _requirePasswordChange_)`

*Arguments:*

[options="header"]

When the user '*johnsmith*' logs in for the first time, he will be required to xref:deprecated-security-procedures/enterprise-edition.adoc#userauth-change-your-password[change his password].

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.security.createUser('johnsmith', 'h6u4%kr')
----

.Delete the specified role
====
The following example deletes the custom role '*operator*' from the system.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.security.deleteRole('operator')
----
====


[[userauth-delete-user]]
== Delete the specified user

An administrator is able to delete permanently a user from the system.
It is not possible to undo this action, so, if in any doubt, consider xref:deprecated-security-procedures/enterprise-edition.adoc#userauth-suspend-user[suspending the user] instead.

*Syntax:*

`CALL dbms.security.deleteUser(_username_)`

*Arguments:*

| The username matches that of the current user (i.e. deleting the current user is not permitted).
|===

*Considerations:*

|===
| It is not necessary to remove any assigned roles from the user prior to deleting the user.
| Deleting a user will terminate with immediate effect all of the user's sessions and roll back any running transactions.
| As it is not possible for the current user to delete themselves, there will always be at least one administrator in the system.

[[user-roles-remove-role-from-user]]
== Unassign a role from the user

An administrator is able to remove a role from any user in the system,
thus preventing the user from performing upon the data any actions prescribed by the role.

*Syntax:*

`CALL dbms.security.removeRoleFromUser(_roleName_, _username_)`

*Arguments:*

[options="header"]
|===
| Name                  | Type      | Description

| As it is not possible for the current user to remove the `admin` role from themselves, there will always be at least one administrator in the system.
| This is an idempotent procedure.
|===

.Unassign a role from the user
====
The following example removes the role `publisher` from the user with username '*johnsmith*'.

| The username matches that of the current user (i.e. suspending the current user is not permitted).
|===

*Considerations:*

|===
| Suspending a user will terminate with immediate effect all of the user's sessions and roll back any running transactions.
| All of the suspended user's attributes -- assigned roles and password -- will remain intact.
| A suspended user will not be able to log on to the system.
| As it is not possible for the current user to suspend themselves, there will always be at least one active administrator in the system.
| This is an idempotent procedure.
|===

.Suspend the specified user
====
The following example suspends a user with the username '*billjones*'.
