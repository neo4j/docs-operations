= Store formats
:description: This page describes store formats in Neo4j.

The store format dictates how a database in Neo4j, is stored on disk.
The available formats are:

* `aligned` label:default[Default]
* `standard`
* `high_limit` label:enterprise-edition[]
* `block` label:enterprise-edition[] label:version-number[GA in Neo4j 5.16]

Neo4j's newest store format is `block`.
It has the best performance and supports the highest limits.

The `block` format is intended to replace all the older formats.
It uses a range of different data structures and inlining techniques to achieve data locality and store related data together on disk.
This allows more related data to be fetched by fewer read operations, resulting in better resource utilization.

The older store formats are based on the original `standard` format, each with different features and limitations.
`aligned`, `standard`, and `high_limit` formats store most graph data in linked list-like structures on disk.
The `aligned` format performs better than the `standard` but requires slightly more disk space.
The `high-limit` format allows more nodes and relationships to be stored than `standard` but performs slightly worse and requires more disk space.


== How to set the database store format

You can either set the store format when creating a new database or change the store format of an existing database.

=== Creating new databases

The default store format for all new databases is `aligned`.
If you want to change it, you can set a new value for the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] configuration in the _neo4j.conf_ file.

You can also create a new database on a specific store format by passing the new format as an argument to the command creating the database, for example, xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-full[`neo4j-admin database import full`] or xref:backup-restore/copy-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin database copy`] commands, or by using `storeFormat:` option in the Cypher command `CREATE DATABASE`.

The following examples show how to create a new database on the `block` store format.
However, the same applies to other formats.

.Specify the store format when importing a database using the `neo4j-admin database import full` command
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full ... --format=block blockdb
----

.Specify the store format when copying a database using the `neo4j-admin database copy` command
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database copy --to-format="block" mydb blockdb
----

.Specify the store format when creating a new database using the `CREATE DATABASE` Cypher statement
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE blockdb OPTIONS {storeFormat: 'block'}
----
=== Changing the store format of existing databases

Changing the store format is possible by re-writing all data in the new format.
Therefore, it requires that:

* There is enough disk space for both old and new copies of the database.
* The graph fits within the new <<store-formats-entity-limits, format's entity limits>>.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the store format can be a time-consuming operation, depending on the size and complexity of the data in the database.
Performance heavily depends on the speed of the disk and the amount of available memory.
====

[[change-store-format-standalone]]
==== In a standalone server

Changing the store format of an existing database in a standalone server requires the database to be offline.
The following steps assume that you want to migrate the database called `mydb` to `block` format but the same steps apply to other formats.

. Stop the database using the Cypher command `STOP DATABASE mydb`.
. Change the store format of the stopped database using *one* of the following options:

* Migrate an existing database using xref:tools/neo4j-admin/migrate-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin database migrate`] command.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to run `neo4j-admin database copy` with the `--compact-node-store` option prior to running `neo4j-admin database migrate`.
The database is inherently compacted during the migration process.
====
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database migrate --to-format="block" mydb
----

* Pass the new store format as an argument when using the xref:backup-restore/copy-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin database copy`] command to create a copy of an existing database.
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database copy --to-format="block" mydb blockdb
----
. After the successful completion, start the database using the Cypher command `START DATABASE mydb`.

[[change-store-format-cluster]]
==== In a cluster

Changing the store format of an existing database in a cluster requires that you restore a backup of the database that you want to migrate on one of the servers, and then, use that server as a xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-designated-seeder[designated seeder] for the other cluster members to copy that database from.

The following steps assume that you want to migrate the database called `mydb` to `block` format but the same steps apply to other formats.
The database is hosted on three servers in primary mode.

**On one of the servers, `server01`**

. In Cypher Shell, put the database that you want to migrate in read-only mode using the Cypher command xref:database-administration/standard-databases/alter-databases.adoc#manage-databases-alter[`ALTER DATABASE ...â€‹ SET ACCESS READ ONLY`].
For example:
+
[source,cypher]
----
@system> ALTER DATABASE mydb SET ACCESS READ ONLY;
----
. In your command-line tool, back up that database using the xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database backup`] command.
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database backup mydb --to-path=/path/to/your-backup-folder --include-metadata=all
----
. Back in Cypher Shell, drop the database to delete it and all users and roles associated with it:
+
[source,cypher]
----
@system> DROP DATABASE mydb;
----
. In the command-line tool, restore the backup that you created using the xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database restore`] command:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --from-path=/path/to/your-backup-folder/mydb-2024-03-05T11-26-38.backup mydb
----
. Migrate the restored database to `block` format:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to run `neo4j-admin database copy` with the `--compact-node-store` option prior to running `neo4j-admin database migrate`.
The database is inherently compacted during the migration process.
====
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database migrate --to-format="block" mydb
----
. In Cypher Shell, run `SHOW SERVERS` to find the server ID of `server01`.
Cross-reference the address to find the server ID.
Use any database to connect.
+
[source,shell]
----
SHOW SERVERS YIELD serverId, name, address, state, health, hosting
----

**On one of the servers:**

. Use the `system` database and create the migrated database `mydb` using the server ID of `server01`.
The topology of `mydb` is stored in the `system` database and when you create it, it is allocated according to the default topology (which can be shown with `CALL dbms.showTopologyGraphConfig`).
For more information, see xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-designated-seeder[Designated seeder].
+
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE mydb OPTIONS {existingData: 'use', existingDataSeedInstance: '<server01 id>'}
----
. Verify that the database is created and available using the Cypher command `SHOW DATABASE mydb`.
. After the successful completion, restore the roles and permissions.
For more information, see xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc#_restore_users_and_roles_metadata[Restore users and roles metadata].


=== Verify the store format

You can verify the store format of a database using the following Cypher:

[source,cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, store
----

.Result
[role="queryresult"]
----
+----------------------------------+
| name      | store                |
+----------------------------------+
| "blockdb" | "block-block-1.1"    |
| "neo4j"   | "record-aligned-1.1" |
| "system"  | "record-aligned-1.1" |
+----------------------------------+
----

Additionally, you can use the `neo4j-admin database info` command to get detailed information about the store format of a database.
For details, see xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-store-info.adoc[Display store information].

=== Effects of store format choice

The store format is responsible for how data is written to disk and how to read it.
Some key aspects that may differ between formats are:

* The performance and resource consumption of read and write transactions.
An operation may be faster on one store format than another.
* Size of database files on disk.
Two databases containing identical logical data may have different sizes due to different formats.
* Which files/filenames exist in the database directory.
* Performance in memory-constrained environments.
The same query on different formats may have a different page cache hit ratio when the database does not entirely fit in the page cache.
* The amount of data that can be stored.
See <<store-formats-entity-limits, Store formats and entity limits>> for limitations of the individual formats.
* The order of query results when the order is not specified.
Different store formats may traverse and return data in different order.
* Algorithms used by the Neo4j Admin tools.
Especially `neo4j-admin database check` and `neo4j-admin database import` commands.
Performance and resource utilization may differ.
