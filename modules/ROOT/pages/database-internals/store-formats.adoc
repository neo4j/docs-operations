= Store formats
:description: This page describes store formats in Neo4j.

Neo4j's storage engine supports several store formats that describe how data is written to disk.
Starting from 5.23, `block` format is the recommended format for Enterprise Edition due to its superior performance and scalability.
`block` format uses advanced data structures and inlining techniques to enhance data locality, which leads to better resource utilization.

`aligned` is the recommended format for Community Edition.

`standard` and `high_limit` formats are deprecated starting from Neo4j 5.23.
It is not recommended to use these formats for new databases.
For more information on the deprecation and timeline for the eventual removal of these formats, see <<format-deprecations, Format deprecations>>.

[[store-format-overview]]
== Available store formats

Here’s an overview of the available formats and their features:

Block:: label:enterprise-edition[] label:version-number[GA in Neo4j 5.16] +
* Default format from Neo4j 5.22 for new databases (unless xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc##config_db.format[`db.format`] is specified).
* *Performance:* Fast queries; uses advanced data structures and inlining techniques for better data locality.
* *Memory efficiency:* Optimized collocation of data, which allows more related data to be fetched by fewer read operations; enhancing resource utilization.
Block format means a few pages need to be loaded to serve a query, i.e. fewer page faults and less IO.
* *Property access:* Properties are stored in blocks with their nodes and relationships drastically reducing the amount of pointer chasing required to access properties.
* *Entity limits:* Able to run graphs at large scales.
Supports the highest limits at the time of writing.
See <<block-format-limits, Block format entity limits>> for details.
* *Future-proofing:* Designed to be extended and improved without requiring store migrations. New features such as data types, or performance enhancements are available without rewriting the store.

Aligned::
* Default format in Community Edition and for all new databases in Enterprise Edition prior to Neo4j 5.22.
* *Performance:* Performs better than `standard` but requires slightly more disk space.
* *Memory efficiency:* Based on `standard` but with improved memory efficiency.
* *Property access:* Stores graph data in linked list-like structures on disk.
* *Entity limits:* Supports graphs within some limits.
See <<aligned-limits, Aligned format entity limits>> for details.

Standard:: label:deprecated[Deprecated in 5.23]
* *Performance:* Basic, foundational format.
* *Property access:* Stores graph data in linked list-like structures on disk.
* *Entity limits:* Supports graphs within some limits.
See <<standard-limits, Standard format entity limits>> for details.
* For information on deprecation and eventual removal, see <<format-deprecations, Format deprecations>>.

High_limit:: label:enterprise-edition[] label:deprecated[Deprecated in 5.23]
* *Performance:* Performs slightly worse than `standard` and requires more disk space, but allows more nodes and relationships.
* *Memory efficiency:* Based on `standard` but with improved memory efficiency.
* *Property access:* Stores graph data in linked list-like structures on disk.
* *Entity limits:* From the record formats, supports the highest limits at the time of writing.
For more information, see <<high-format-limits, High_limit format entity limits>>.
* For information on deprecation and eventual removal, see <<format-deprecations, Format deprecations>>.

[[format-deprecations]]
== Format deprecations

`standard` and `high_limit` formats are deprecated starting from Neo4j 5.23.

`block` format provides better performance and scalability than the deprecated formats.
They will remain part of the product throughout the v5 and vNext server lifecycles.
The last version of Neo4j to include these formats will be vNext.LTS which is planned for release in November 2026.
LTS versions of Neo4j are supported for 3 years following their release.
This means that support for `standard` and `high_limit` formats is planned to end in November 2029.

It is recommended that Enterprise Edition users migrate all databases to `block` format at their earliest convenience to ensure the best possible performance.
For more information, see <<change-store-format, Changing the store format of existing databases>>.

[[how-to-set-store-format]]
== How to set the database store format

You can either set the store format when creating a new database or change the store format of an existing database.

[[create-new-databases]]
=== Creating new databases

In versions previous to Neo4j 5.22, the default store format for all new databases is `aligned`.
From Neo4j 5.22, `block` is the default format for all newly-created databases as long as they do not have the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] setting specified. +
If you want to change it, you can set a new value for the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] configuration in the _neo4j.conf_ file. +
You can also create a new database on a specific store format by passing the new format as an argument to the command creating the database, for example, xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-full[`neo4j-admin database import full`] or xref:backup-restore/copy-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin database copy`] commands, or by using `storeFormat:` option in the Cypher command `CREATE DATABASE`.

The following examples show how to create a new database on the `block` store format.
However, the same applies to other formats.

.Specify the store format when importing a database using the `neo4j-admin database import full` command
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full ... --format=block blockdb
----

.Specify the store format when copying a database using the `neo4j-admin database copy` command
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database copy --to-format="block" mydb blockdb
----

.Specify the store format when creating a new database using the `CREATE DATABASE` Cypher statement
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE blockdb OPTIONS {storeFormat: 'block'}
----


[[change-store-format]]
=== Changing the store format of existing databases

Starting from 5.23, `block` format is the preferred format for Enterprise Edition due to its superior performance and scalability.
Therefore, migrating all databases to `block` format is recommended to ensure optimal performance.

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that changing the store format changes the internal IDs assigned to nodes and relationships.
This is because the ID represents the element’s physical location in the store file.
====

Changing the store format is an IO-intensive offline operation, which re-writes all data in the new format.
Therefore, it requires that:

* There is enough disk space for both old and new copies of the database.
During the migration to `block` format, the database is inherently compacted.
Therefore, the disk space required for the migration is approximately the same as the size of the database.
You can use the xref:monitoring/metrics/reference.adoc#db-store-size-metrics[database store size metrics] to determine your available disk space and potentially reusable space.
* The graph fits within the new <<store-formats-entity-limits, format's entity limits>>.

[NOTE]
====
For large databases changing the store format can be a time-consuming operation and will also require any indexes to be re-populated.
The time required depends on the size of the database, number of indices, speed of the storage devices, and the amount of available memory.
For example, a 100GB database might take 10 minutes in optimal conditions, or over an hour in the worst case.
Therefore, it is recommended to perform a dry run on a backup to estimate the required time for the migration.
====

[[change-store-format-standalone]]
==== In a standalone server

Changing the store format of an existing database in a standalone server requires the database to be offline.
The following steps assume that you want to migrate the database called `mydb` to `block` format but the same steps apply to other formats.

. Stop the database using the Cypher command `STOP DATABASE mydb`.
. Change the store format of the stopped database using *one* of the following options:

* Migrate an existing database using xref:tools/neo4j-admin/migrate-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin database migrate`] command.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to run `neo4j-admin database copy` with the `--compact-node-store` option prior to running `neo4j-admin database migrate`.
The database is inherently compacted during the migration process.
====
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database migrate --to-format="block" mydb
----

* Pass the new store format as an argument when using the xref:backup-restore/copy-database.adoc[`neo4j-admin database copy`] command to create a copy of an existing database.
You can also set the `--copy-schema` option to automatically copy the schema definitions.
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database copy --to-format="block" mydb blockdb --copy-schema
----
. After the successful completion, start the database using the Cypher command `START DATABASE mydb`.
Indexes are populated the first time the database is started, which might take some time if there are uniqueness constraints.

[[change-store-format-cluster]]
==== In a cluster

Changing the store format of an existing database in a cluster requires that you restore a backup of the database that you want to migrate on one of the servers, and then, use that server as a xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-designated-seeder[designated seeder] for the other cluster members to copy that database from.

The following steps assume that you want to migrate the database called `mydb` to `block` format but the same steps apply to other formats.
The database is hosted on three servers in primary mode.

**On one of the servers, `server01`**

. In Cypher Shell, put the database that you want to migrate in read-only mode using the Cypher command xref:database-administration/standard-databases/alter-databases.adoc#manage-databases-alter[`ALTER DATABASE databasename​ SET ACCESS READ ONLY`].
For example:
+
[source,cypher]
----
@system> ALTER DATABASE mydb SET ACCESS READ ONLY;
----
. In your command-line tool, back up that database using the xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database backup`] command.
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database backup mydb --to-path=/path/to/your-backup-folder --include-metadata=all
----
. Back in Cypher Shell, drop the database to delete it and all users and roles associated with it:
+
[source,cypher]
----
@system> DROP DATABASE mydb;
----
. In the command-line tool, restore the backup that you created using the xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database restore`] command:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --from-path=/path/to/your-backup-folder/mydb-2024-03-05T11-26-38.backup mydb
----
. Migrate the restored database to `block` format:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to run `neo4j-admin database copy` with the `--compact-node-store` option prior to running `neo4j-admin database migrate`.
The database is inherently compacted during the migration process.
====
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database migrate --to-format="block" mydb
----
. In Cypher Shell, run `SHOW SERVERS` to find the server ID of `server01`.
Cross-reference the address to find the server ID.
Use any database to connect.
+
[source,shell]
----
SHOW SERVERS YIELD serverId, name, address, state, health, hosting
----

**On one of the servers:**

. Use the `system` database and create the migrated database `mydb` using the server ID of `server01`.
The topology of `mydb` is stored in the `system` database and when you create it, it is allocated according to the default topology (which can be shown with `CALL dbms.showTopologyGraphConfig`).
For more information, see xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-designated-seeder[Designated seeder].
+
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE mydb OPTIONS {existingData: 'use', existingDataSeedInstance: '<server01 id>'}
----
. Verify that the database is created and available using the Cypher command `SHOW DATABASE mydb`.
. After the successful completion, restore the roles and permissions.
For more information, see xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc#_restore_users_and_roles_metadata[Restore users and roles metadata].

[[verify-store-format]]
=== Verify the store format

You can verify the store format of a database using the following Cypher:

[source,cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name, store
----

.Result
[role="queryresult"]
----
+----------------------------------+
| name      | store                |
+----------------------------------+
| "blockdb" | "block-block-1.1"    |
| "neo4j"   | "record-aligned-1.1" |
| "system"  | "record-aligned-1.1" |
+----------------------------------+
----

Additionally, you can use the `neo4j-admin database info` command to get detailed information about the store format of a database.
For details, see xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-store-info.adoc[Display store information].
