:description: Database internals and transactional behavior

To maintain data integrity and ensure reliable transactional behavior, Neo4j DBMS supports transactions with full ACID properties, and it uses a write-ahead transaction log to ensure durability.

* **Atomicity** -- If a part of a transaction fails, the database state is left unchanged.
* **Consistency** -- Every transaction leaves the database in a consistent state.
* **Isolation** -- During a transaction, modified data cannot be accessed by other operations.
* **Durability** -- The DBMS can always recover the results of a committed transaction.

Neo4j DBMS supports the following transactional behavior:

* All database operations that access the graph, indexes, or schema must be performed in a transaction.
* The default isolation level is _read-committed_ isolation level.
* Write locks are acquired automatically at the node and relationship levels.
However, you can also manually acquire write locks if you want to achieve a higher level of isolation -- _serializable_ isolation level.
* Data retrieved by traversals is not protected from modification by other transactions.
* Non-repeatable reads may occur (i.e., only write locks are acquired and held until the end of the transaction).
* Deadlock detection is built into the core transaction management.
