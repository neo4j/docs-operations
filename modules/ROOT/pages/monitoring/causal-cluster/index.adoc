= Monitoring a Causal Cluster
:description: This section covers additional facilities available for monitoring a Neo4j Causal Cluster. 

In addition to specific metrics as described in previous sections, Neo4j Causal Clusters provide an infrastructure that operators will wish to monitor.
The procedures can be used to inspect the cluster state and to understand its current condition and topology.
Additionally, there are HTTP endpoints for checking health and status.
