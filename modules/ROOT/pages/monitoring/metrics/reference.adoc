You should use caution when interpreting unfamiliar metrics.
Reading the xref:performance/index.adoc[] section is recommended to better understand the metrics.

[[metrics-types]]
== Types of metrics

Neo4j has the following types of metrics:

* Global -- covers the whole Neo4j DBMS.
* Per database -- covers an individual database.

The metrics fall into one of the following categories:

* Gauge -- shows an instantaneous reading of a particular value.
* Counter -- shows an accumulated value.
* Histogram -- shows the distribution of values.

[[metrics-global]]
=== Global metrics

Global metrics cover the whole database management system and represent the system's status as a whole.

Global metrics have the following name format:

* `<metrics-prefix>.dbms.<metric-name>`, where the <user-configured-prefix> can be configured with the `xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.metrics.prefix[server.metrics.prefix]` configuration setting.

Metrics of this type are reported as soon as the database management system is available.
For example, all JVM-related metrics are global.
In particular, the `neo4j.dbms.vm.thread.count` metric has a default user-configured-prefix `neo4j` and the global metric name is `vm.thread.count`.

By default, global metrics include:


* Bolt metrics
* Page cache metrics
* GC metrics
* Thread metrics
* Database operation metrics
* Web Server metrics
* JVM metrics

=== Database metrics

Each database metric is reported for a particular database only.
Database metrics are only available during the lifetime of the database.
When a database becomes unavailable, all of its metrics become unavailable also.

Database metrics have the following name format:

* `<user-configured-prefix>.database.<database-name>.<metric-name>`, where the <user-configured-prefix> can be configured with the `xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.metrics.prefix[server.metrics.prefix]` configuration setting.

For example, any transaction metric is a database metric.
In particular, the `neo4j.database.mydb.transaction.started` metric has a default user-configured-prefix `neo4j` and is a metric for the `mydb` database.

By default, database metrics include:

 * Transaction metrics
 * Checkpoint metrics
 * Log rotation metrics
 * Database data metrics
 * Cypher metrics
 * Clustering metrics

== General-purpose metrics

.Bolt metrics

[options="header",cols="<3m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|<prefix>.bolt.connections_opened|The total number of Bolt connections opened since startup. This includes both succeeded and failed connections. Useful for monitoring load via the Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.connections_closed|The total number of Bolt connections closed since startup. This includes both properly and abnormally ended connections. Useful for monitoring load via Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.connections_running|The total number of Bolt connections that are currently executing Cypher and returning results. Useful to track the overall load on Bolt connections. This is limited to the number of Bolt worker threads that have been configured via `dbms.connector.bolt.thread_pool_max_size`. Reaching this maximum indicated the server is running at capacity. (gauge)
|<prefix>.bolt.connections_idle|The total number of Bolt connections that are not currently executing Cypher or returning results. (gauge)
|<prefix>.bolt.messages_received|The total number of messages received via Bolt since startup. Useful to track general message activity in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.messages_started|The total number of messages that have started processing since being received. A received message may have begun processing until a Bolt worker thread becomes available. A large gap observed between `bolt.messages_received` and `bolt.messages_started` could indicate the server is running at capacity. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.messages_done|The total number of Bolt messages that have completed processing whether successfully or unsuccessfully. Useful for tracking overall load. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.messages_failed|The total number of messages that have failed while processing. A high number of failures may indicate an issue with the server and further investigation of the logs is recommended. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.accumulated_queue_time|(unsupported feature) When `internal.server.bolt.thread_pool_queue_size` is enabled,  the total time in milliseconds that a Bolt message waits in the processing queue before a Bolt worker thread becomes available to process it. Sharp increases in this value indicate that the server is running at capacity. If `internal.server.bolt.thread_pool_queue_size` is disabled, the value should be `0`, meaning that messages are directly handed off to worker threads. (counter)
|<prefix>.bolt.accumulated_processing_time|The total amount of time in milliseconds that worker threads have been processing messages. Useful for monitoring load via Bolt drivers in combination with other metrics. (counter)
|===

Long checkpoints can be an issue, as these are invoked when the database stops, when a hot backup is taken, and periodically as well. Values over `30` minutes or so should be cause for some investigation. (gauge) 
|<prefix>.check_point.pages_flushed|The number of pages that were flushed during the last checkpoint event. (gauge)

The applied index should always be bigger than or equal to the commit index. The difference between this and the commit index can be used to monitor how up-to-date the follower database is. (gauge)
|<prefix>.cluster.raft.term|The Raft Term of this server. It increases monotonically if you do not unbind the cluster state. (gauge)
|<prefix>.cluster.raft.tx_retries|Transaction retries. (counter)
|<prefix>.cluster.raft.is_leader|Is this server the leader? Track this for each database primary in the cluster. It reports `0` if it is not the leader and `1` if it is the leader. The sum of all of these should always be `1`. However, there are transient periods in which the sum can be more than `1` because more than one member thinks it is the leader. Action may be needed if the metric shows `0` for more than 30 seconds. (gauge)

[[jvm-metrics]]
== Java Virtual Machine Metrics

The JVM metrics show information about garbage collections (for example, the number of events and time spent collecting), memory pools and buffers, and the number of active threads running.
They are environment dependent and therefore, may vary on different hardware and with different JVM configurations.
The metrics about the JVM's memory usage expose values that are provided by the MemoryPoolMXBeans and BufferPoolMXBeans.
The memory pools are memory managed by the JVM, for example, `neo4j.dbms.vm.memory.pool.g1_survivor_space`.
Therefore, if necessary, you can tune them using the JVM settings.
The buffer pools are space outside of the memory managed by the garbage collector.
Neo4j allocates buffers in those pools as it needs them.
You can limit this memory using JVM settings, but there is never any good reason for you to set them.

.JVM file descriptor metrics.

|<prefix>.vm.file.descriptors.maximum|(OS setting) The maximum number of open file descriptors. It is recommended to be set to 40K file handles, because of the native and Lucene indexing Neo4j uses. If this metric gets close to the limit, you should consider raising it. (gauge)
|===

.GC metrics.

[options="header",cols="<3m,<4"]
|===
|Name |Description
|<prefix>.vm.gc.time.<gc>|Accumulated garbage collection time in milliseconds. Long GCs can be an indication of performance issues or potential instability. If this approaches the heartbeat timeout in a cluster, it may cause unwanted leader switches. (counter)
|<prefix>.vm.gc.count.<gc>|Total number of garbage collections. (counter)
|===

Monitor this to identify if you are maxing out consistently, in which case, you should increase the initial and max heap size, or if you are underutilizing, you should decrease the initial and max heap sizes. (gauge)
|<prefix>.vm.heap.max|Maximum amount of heap memory (in bytes) that can be used. This is the amount of heap space currently used at a given point in time.
