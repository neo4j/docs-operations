:description: This chapter describes how to expose the metrics using the default and third-party monitoring tools.

[role=enterprise-edition]
[[metrics-expose]]
= Expose metrics

Neo4j supports the following ways of exposing data for monitoring purposes:

* Neo4j Ops Manager -- a UI-based tool that enables a DBA (or any administrator) to monitor, administer, and operate all of the Neo4j DBMSs in an Enterprise.
* CSV files -- retrieve metrics from CSV files. Enabled by default.
* JMX MBeans -- expose metrics over JMX MBeans. Enabled by default.
* Graphite -- send metrics to https://graphiteapp.org/[Graphite] or any monitoring tool based on the Graphite protocol. Disabled by default.
* Prometheus -- publish metrics for polling as https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] endpoint. Disabled by default.

== Neo4j Ops Manager

The Neo4j metrics data can be viewed via Neo4j Ops Manager (NOM).
For more information on how to install and set up NOM to be used with your Neo4j DBMS, see https://neo4j.com/docs/ops-manager/[Neo4j Ops Manager documentation].

== CSV files

Export metrics to CSV files.

Add the following settings to _neo4j.conf_ in order to enable export of metrics into local .CSV files:

[source, properties]
----
# Enable the CSV exporter. Default is true.
server.metrics.csv.enabled=true
# Directory path for output files.
# Default is the /metrics directory under NEO4J_HOME.
server.directories.metrics=/local/file/system/path
# How often to store data. Default is 30 seconds.
server.metrics.csv.interval=30s
# The maximum number of CSV files that will be saved. Default is 7.
server.metrics.csv.rotation.keep_number=7
# The file size at which the CSV files will auto-rotate. Default is 10.00MiB.
server.metrics.csv.rotation.size=10.00MiB
# Compresses the metric archive files. Default is NONE. Possible values are NONE, ZIP, and GZ.
server.metrics.csv.rotation.compression=ZIP
----

xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.metrics.csv.rotation.compression[`server.metrics.csv.rotation.compression`] selects the compression scheme to use on the files after rotation.
Since CSV files are highly compressible, it is recommended to enable compression of the files to save disk space.

== JMX MBeans

From version 4.2.2 onwards, the JMX metrics are exposed by default over JMX MBeans.

[source, properties]
----
# Enable the JMX MBeans integration. Default is true.
server.metrics.jmx.enabled=true
----

For more information about accessing and adjusting the metrics, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/java-reference/{page-version}/jmx-metrics/[The Java Reference Guide -> JMX metrics].

[[metrics-graphite]]
== Graphite

Send metrics to https://graphiteapp.org/[Graphite] or any monitoring tool based on the Graphite protocol.

Add the following settings to xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[_neo4j.conf_] to enable integration with Graphite:

[source, properties]
----
# Enable the Graphite integration. Default is false.
server.metrics.graphite.enabled=true
# The hostname or IP address of the Graphite server.
# A socket address in the format <hostname>, <hostname>:<port>, or :<port>.
# If missing, the port or hostname is acquired from server.default_listen_address.
# The default port number for Graphite is 2003.
server.metrics.graphite.server=localhost:2003
# How often to send data. Default is 30 seconds.
server.metrics.graphite.interval=30s
# Prefix for Neo4j metrics on Graphite server.
server.metrics.prefix=neo4j
----

Start Neo4j and connect to Graphite via a web browser to monitor your Neo4j metrics.

[NOTE]
--
If you configure the Graphite server to be a hostname or DNS entry, you should be aware that the JVM resolves hostnames to IP addresses and, by default, caches the result indefinitely for security reasons.
This is controlled by the value of `networkaddress.cache.ttl` in the JVM Security properties.
See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html for more information.

== Prometheus

Publish metrics for polling as https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] endpoint.

Add the following settings to _neo4j.conf_ to enable the Prometheus endpoint.

[source, properties]
----
# Enable the Prometheus endpoint. Default is false.
server.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true
# The hostname and port to use as Prometheus endpoint.
# A socket address is in the format <hostname>, <hostname>:<port>, or :<port>.
# If missing, the port or hostname is acquired from server.default_listen_address.
# The default is localhost:2004.
server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=localhost:2004
----

When Neo4j is fully started, a Prometheus endpoint will be available at the configured address.

[WARNING]
====
You should never expose the Prometheus endpoint directly to the Internet.
If security is of paramount importance, you should set `server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=localhost:2004` and configure a reverse HTTP proxy on the same machine that handles the authentication, SSL, caching, etc.
====
If you can afford to send unencrypted metrics within the internal network, such as `server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=10.0.0.123:2004`, all servers within the same netmask will be able to access it.

If you specify anything more permissive, such as `server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=0.0.0.0:2004`, you should have a firewall rule to prevent any unauthorized access.
Data in transit will still not be encrypted, so it should never go over any insecure networks.
