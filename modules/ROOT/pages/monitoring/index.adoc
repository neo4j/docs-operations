:description: This chapter describes the tools that are available for monitoring Neo4j. 

Neo4j provides mechanisms for continuous analysis through the output of metrics as well as the inspection and management of currently-executing queries.

Logs can be harvested for continuous analysis, or for specific investigations.
Facilities are available for producing security event logs as well as query logs.
The query management functionality is provided for specific investigations into query performance.
Monitoring features are also provided for ad-hoc analysis of a Causal Cluster.
