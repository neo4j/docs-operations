== Logging framework

Neo4j provides logs for monitoring purposes.
As of Neo4j 5.0, Neo4j uses https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j 2] for logging.
Log4j 2 can be configured using the two XML files _conf/server-logs.xml_ and _conf/user-log.xml_.
The XML files are passed to Log4j.

Neo4j supports all default Log4j components.
You can also add plugins to Log4j by dropping them in the _plugin_ directory.
For more advanced usages, see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Log4j official documentation].

The following is a description of how a default Neo4j installation behaves and some typical examples of configuring it to use Log4j.

== Log files
By default, the directory where the general log files are located is configured by xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.directories.logs[`server.directories.logs`].

The following table describes the Neo4j general log files and the information they contain.

| _service-error.log_
| The _windows service log_
| label:Windows[]Logs information about errors encountered when installing or running the Windows service.
|===

== Logging configuration file anatomy

The logging configuration is done using a Log4j 2 XML configuration file.

Neo4j has two different configuration files, one for the _neo4j.log_, which contains general information about Neo4j, and one configuration file for all other types of logging (except _gc.log_, see xref:monitoring/logging.adoc#garbage-collection-log-file-configuration[GC Logging]).

Where the files are located and which logs are enabled or disabled is managed via the _neo4j.conf_ file.

.Log configuration settings in _neo4j.conf_
[cols="2m,1m,3a", options="header"]
|===
| Configuration setting
| Default value
| Description

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.config[`server.logs.config`]
| `conf/server-logs.xml`
| Path to the XML configuration file for _debug.log_, _http.log_, _query.log_, and _security.log_.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.user.config[`server.logs.user.config`]
| `conf/user-logs.xml`
| Path to the XML configuration file for _neo4j.log_ file.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.debug.enabled[`server.logs.debug.enabled`]
| `true`
| Enable/disable the _debug.log_.
It is highly recommended to keep it enabled.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.logs.http.enabled[`dbms.logs.http.enabled`]
| `false`
| Enable/disable the _http.log_.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.enabled[`db.logs.query.enabled`]
| `VERBOSE`
| Must be one of `OFF`, `INFO`, or `VERBOSE`.
`INFO` produces less output than `VERBOSE`, while `OFF` completely disables the _query.log_.
|===


The Log4j 2 XML configuration file consists of 3 major components:

* _Appenders_ -- define output locations, for example, a file, the console, network socket, etc.
* _Layouts_ -- define how the output is formatted, for example, plain text, JSON, CSV, etc.
* _Loggers_ -- route log events to one or several appenders.

You can also configure filters to determine if and what log events to be published and how.
For more information, see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#Filters[Log4j official documentation].

.Breakdown of the illustrative Log4j 2 configuration file line per line
[cols="8h,~", options="header"]
|===
| Line(s)
| Description

| 1
| Configuration tag with a `monitorInterval` of 30 seconds and a package namespace of `org.neo4j.logging.log4j`. +
The monitor interval tells Log4j to periodically check the XML file for changes and reload the file if a change is detected. +
The package namespace gives access to the Neo4j configuration lookup with `${config:<setting>}`.

| 3, 13
| Defines two `<RollingFile>` appenders.
  One writes to _debug.log_ and one to _http.log_.
  The `name` must be unique and is used later when referencing the appender.

| 4, 14
| Specifies a `filePattern` to be used when the file is rolled.
  The pattern renames the files to _debug.log.01_ and _http.log.01_ when they reach the defined trigger.

| 5
| Defines the layout to use for the `DebugLog` appender, in this case with the `GMT+2` timezone.

| 8, 17
| Defines a size-based trigger.
When the size of the files reaches 20 MB, the files are renamed according to the `filePattern`, and the log files start over.

| 10
| Defines a rollover strategy, keeping 7 files as history.
`fileIndex=min` implies that the minimum/the lowest number is the most recent one.

| 24, 25
| Defines a root logger with log level `INFO`.
The root logger is a "catch-all" logger that captures everything that is not captured by the other loggers.
Everything caught is sent to the appender with the name `DebugLog`.

| 28, 29
| Defines a logger that matches log events with the `HttpLogger` target with a log level of `INFO` or above.
The `additivity="false"` is set to fully consume the log event.
If `additivity="true"` is set, which is the default, the log event is also sent to the root logger.
|===

[[general-logging-appenders]]
=== Appenders
An appender represents a destination for log events.
All Log4j standard appenders are available in Neo4j.
For more details, see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html[Log4j official documentation].
A few of the most common appenders are `<Console>`, `<RollingFile>`, and `<RollingRandomAccessFile>`.

==== `<Console>` appender
The console appender outputs log events to _stdout_ or _stderr_.

.An example of a console appender
[source,xml]
----
<Console name="console" target="SYSTEM_OUT"> <!-- or SYSTEM_ERR -->
  <PatternLayout pattern="%m%n"/>
</Console>
----

==== `<RollingFile>` appender
A rolling file appender writes log events to a file.
It rolls when certain criteria are met.
A standard scheme is to keep one log file daily or roll a log file once a specific size is reached.

.An example of a rolling file appender with one new log file each day
[source,xml]
----
<RollingFile name="myLog" fileName="${config:server.directories.logs}/my.log"
                       filePattern="${config:server.directories.logs}/my-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log">
  <!-- Layout -->
  <Policies>
      <TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy />
  </Policies>
</RollingFile>
----

The rolling also supports compression of rolled-out files.
Adding one of `.gz`, `.zip`, `.bz2`, `.deflate`, or `.pack200` as a suffix to the `filePattern` attribute causes the file to be compressed with the appropriate compression scheme.

.An example of a rolling file appender with zip compression
[source,xml]
----
<RollingFile name="myLog" fileName="${config:server.directories.logs}/my.log"
                       filePattern="${config:server.directories.logs}/my.%i.log.zip">
  <!-- Layout -->
  <Policies>
      <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="20 MB"/>
  </Policies>
</RollingFile>
----

==== `<RollingRandomAccessFile>` appender
The `<RollingRandomAccessFile>` is almost identical to the `<RollingFile`, with one major exception - all writes are buffered.

The drawback of using this appender is that log events might *not* be visible immediately and can be lost in case of a system crash.
If these drawbacks are acceptable, switching to `<RollingRandomAccessFile>` can increase the performance of the logging.

[[general-logging-log-layout]]
=== Log layouts
The log files can be written in a lot of different ways, referred to as layouts.
Neo4j comes bundled with all the default layouts of Log4j 2, as well as a few Neo4j-specific ones.
For more details on the default Log4j 2 layouts, see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html[Log4j official documentation].

[[general-logging-pattern-layout]]
==== `<PatternLayout>`
The most common layout.
The pattern layout is a flexible layout configurable with a pattern string.
The pattern consists of different converters that are prefixed with `%`.
An example pattern could be

[source,xml]
----
<PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ}{GMT+0} %-5p [%c{1.}] %m%n"/>
----
It contains the following converters:

.Example pattern layout converters
[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Converter
| Description

a| `%d{_date-pattern_}{_timezone_}`
| Date of the log event.
 The time zone is optional.
 If omitted, the system time is used.

a| `%p`
a| The log level of the event.
  Can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`.
  Adding `-5` between the `%` symbol and the `p` pads the level to be exactly 5 characters long.

a| `%c`
a| The class where the log event originated from.
  Adding `{1.}` after compacts the package names, e.g. `org.apache.commons.Foo` will become `o.a.c.Foo`.

a| `%m`
| The log message of the log event.

a| `%n`
| System-specific new line.
|===

These are just a few examples.
For all available converters, consult the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternLayout[Log4j 2 Pattern Layout documentation].

[[general-logging-debug-log-pattern]]
==== `<Neo4jDebugLogLayout>`
The Neo4j debug log layout is essentially the same as the xref:monitoring/logging.adoc#general-logging-pattern-layout[`PatternLayout`].
The main difference is that a header is injected at the start of the log file with diagnostic information useful for Neo4j developers.
This layout should typically only be used for the _debug.log_ file.

.An example usage of the Neo4j debug log layout
[source,xml]
----
<Neo4jDebugLogLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ}{GMT+0} %-5p [%c{1.}] %m%n"/>
----

[[general-logging-json-template-layout]]
==== `<JsonTemplateLayout>`
The `<JsonTemplateLayout>` is equivalent to the pattern layout.
For more information, see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/json-template-layout.html[Log4j official documentation].

The JSON template layout takes an event template, which can be a file residing on the file system, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<JsonTemplateLayout eventTemplateUri="file://path/to/template.json"/>
----

Alternatively, you can embed it right into the XML:

[source%linenums,xml,highlight=4..12]
----
<JsonTemplateLayout>
  <eventTemplate>
    <![CDATA[
      {
        "time": { "$resolver": "timestamp",
          "pattern": { "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ", "timeZone": "UTC" }
        },
        "level": { "$resolver": "level", "field": "name" },
        "message": { "$resolver": "message" },
        "includeFullMap": { "$resolver": "map", "flatten": true },
        "stacktrace": { "$resolver": "exception", "field": "message" }
      }
    ]]>
  </eventTemplate>
</JsonTemplateLayout>
----
There are also a couple of built-in templates available from the classpath, for example:
[source,xml]
----
<JsonTemplateLayout eventTemplateUri="classpath:org/neo4j/logging/StructuredJsonLayout.json"/>
----

.Available built-in templates
[cols="3m,3a", options="header"]
|===
| _eventTemplateUri_
| Description

| classpath:org/neo4j/logging/StructuredJsonLayout.json
| Layout for structured log messages.
  Only applicable to the _query.log_ and _security.log_.

| classpath:org/neo4j/logging/StructuredLayoutWithMessage.json
| Generic layout for logging JSON messages.
  Can be used for any log file.

| classpath:org/neo4j/logging/QueryLogJsonLayout.json
| Backward compatible JSON layout that will match the Neo4j 4.x query log.

| classpath:LogstashJsonEventLayoutV1.json
| https://github.com/logstash/log4j-jsonevent-layout[Logstash `json_event` pattern for Log4j]

| classpath:GelfLayout.json
| https://docs.graylog.org/en/3.1/pages/gelf.html#gelf-payload-specification[Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) payload specification] with additional `_thread` and `_logger` fields.

| classpath:GcpLayout.json
| https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/structured-logging[Google Cloud Platform structured logging] with additional `_thread`, `_logger`, and `_exception` fields.

| classpath:JsonLayout.json
| Same layout as the less flexible `<JsonLayout>`.
|===

=== Loggers

Loggers forward log events to appenders.
There can be an arbitrary number of `<Logger>` elements but only one `<Root>` logger element.
Loggers have the possibility of being additive.
An additive logger forwards a log event to its appender(s) and then passes the log event to the next matching logger.
A non-additive logger forwards a log event to its appender(s) and then drops the event.
The root logger is a special logger that matches everything, so if another logger does not pick up a log event, the root logger will.
Therefore, it is best practice always to include a root logger so that no log events are missed.

.Configuration of loggers
[source%linenums,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<Configuration>
    <!-- Appenders -->
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="WARN">
            <AppenderRef ref="DebugLog"/>
        </Root>

        <Logger name="HttpLogger" level="INFO" additivity="false">
            <AppenderRef ref="HttpLog"/>
        </Logger>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

A logger has a `level` that filters log events.
A level can also include levels of different severity.
For example, a logger with `level="INFO"` forwards log events with `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.
A logger with `level="WARN"` only logs `WARN` and `ERROR` events.

The following table lists all log levels raised by Neo4j and their severity level:

.Log levels
[cols="1m,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Message type
| Severity level
| Description

a| `DEBUG`
| Low severity
| Report details on the raised errors and possible solutions.

a| `INFO`
| Low severity
| Report status information and errors that are not severe.

a| `WARN`
| Low severity
| Report errors that need attention but are not severe.

a| `ERROR`
| High severity
| Reports errors that prevent the Neo4j server from running and must be addressed immediately.
|===


For more details on loggers, see the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#Loggers[Log4j official documentation -> Configuring Loggers].

[[garbage-collection-log-file-configuration]]
=== Garbage collection log
The garbage collection log, or GC log for short, is special and cannot be configured with Log4j 2.
The GC log is handled by the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and must be passed directly to the command line.
To simplify this process, Neo4j exposes the following settings in _neo4j.conf_:

._Garbage collection log_ configurations
[cols="3,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| The _garbage collection log_ configuration
| Default value
| Description

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.gc.enabled[`server.logs.gc.enabled`]
| `false`
| Enable garbage collection logging.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.gc.options[`server.logs.gc.options`]
a| `-Xlog:gc*,safepoint,age*=trace`
| Garbage collection logging options.
For available options, consult the documentation of the JVM distribution used.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.gc.rotation.keep_number[`server.logs.gc.rotation.keep_number`]
| `5`
| The maximum number of history files for the garbage collection log.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.logs.gc.rotation.size[`server.logs.gc.rotation.size`]
| `20MB`
| The threshold size for rotation of the garbage collection log.

|===

[role=enterprise-edition]
[[security-events-logging]]
=== Security log

Neo4j provides security event logging that records all security events.
The security log is enabled automatically when the configuration xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_enabled[`dbms.security.auth_enabled`] is set to `true`.

For native user management, the following actions are recorded:

* Login attempts -- by default, both successful and unsuccessful logins are recorded.
* All xref:authentication-authorization/access-control.adoc#auth-access-control-security[administration commands] run against the `system` database.
* Authorization failures from role-based access control.

If using LDAP as the authentication method, some cases of LDAP misconfiguration will also be logged, as well as the LDAP server communication events and failures.

If many programmatic interactions are expected, it is advised to disable the logging of successful logins by setting the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.log_successful_authentication[`dbms.security.log_successful_authentication`] parameter in the _neo4j.conf_ file:

[source, properties, role="noheader"]
----
dbms.security.log_successful_authentication=false
----

The following information is available in the JSON format:

.JSON format log entries
[cols="1m,3a", options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| time
| The timestamp of the log message.

| level

[role=enterprise-edition]
[[query-logging]]
=== Query log

Query logging is enabled by default and is controlled by the setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.enabled[`db.logs.query.enabled`].
It helps you analyze long-running queries and does not impact system performance.
The default is to log all queries, but it is recommended to log for queries exceeding a certain threshold.

The following configuration settings are available for the _query log_:

._Query log_ enabled setting
[cols="1,3a", options="header"]
|===
| Option
| Description

| `OFF`
| Completely disable logging.

| `INFO`
a|
Log at the end of queries that have either succeeded or failed.
The xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.threshold[`db.logs.query.threshold`] parameter is used to determine the threshold for logging a query.
If the execution of a query takes longer than this threshold, the query is logged.
Setting the threshold to `0s` results in all queries being logged.

| `VERBOSE`
a| label:default[]Log all queries at both start and finish, regardless of xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.threshold[`db.logs.query.threshold`].
|===

The following configuration settings are available for the query log file:

._Query log_ configurations
[cols="3,2a,3", options="header"]
|===
| The _query log_ configuration
| Default value
| Description

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.early_raw_logging_enabled[`db.logs.query.early_raw_logging_enabled`]
| `false`
a|
Log query text and parameters without obfuscating passwords.
This allows queries to be logged earlier before parsing starts.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.enabled[`db.logs.query.enabled`]
| `VERBOSE`
| Log executed queries.

//New in 4.3
| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.max_parameter_length[`db.logs.query.max_parameter_length`]
| `2147483647`
a|
This configuration option allows you to set a maximum parameter length to include in the log.
Parameters exceeding this length will be truncated and appended with `+...+`.
This applies to each parameter in the query.

//New in 4.3
| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.obfuscate_literals[`db.logs.query.obfuscate_literals`]
| `false`
a|
If `true`, obfuscates all query literals before writing to the log.
This is useful when Cypher queries expose sensitive information.
[NOTE]
====
Node labels, relationship types, and map property keys are still shown.
Changing the setting does not affect cached queries.
Therefore, if you want the switch to have an immediate effect, you must also clear the query cache; `CALL db.clearQueryCaches()`.
====
[WARNING]
====
This does not obfuscate literals in parameters.
If parameter values are not required in the log, set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled[`db.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled=false`].
====

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled[`db.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled`]
| `true`
| Log parameters for the executed queries being logged.
You can disable this configuration setting if you do not want to display sensitive information.

//New in 4.3
| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.plan_description_enabled[`db.logs.query.plan_description_enabled`]
| `false`
a|
This configuration option allows you to log the query plan for each query.
The query plan shows up as a description table and is useful for debugging purposes.
Every time a Cypher query is run, it generates and uses a plan for the execution of the code.
The plan generated can be affected by changes in the database, such as adding a new index.
As a result, it is not possible to historically see what plan was used for the original query execution.
[NOTE]
====
Enabling this option has a performance impact on the database due to the cost of preparing and including the plan in the _query log_.
It is not recommended for everyday use.
====

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.threshold[`db.logs.query.threshold`]
| `0s`
a|
If the query execution takes longer than this threshold, the query is logged once completed (provided query logging is set to `INFO`).
A threshold of `0` seconds logs all queries.

//New in 4.3
| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.transaction.enabled[`db.logs.query.transaction.enabled`]
| `OFF`
a|
Track the start and end of a transaction within the query log.
Log entries are written to the _query log_.
They include the transaction ID for a specific query and the start and end of a transaction.
You can also choose a level of logging (`OFF`, `INFO`, or `VERBOSE`).
If `INFO` is selected, you must exceed the time before the log is written (`db.logs.query.transaction.threshold`).

//New in 4.3
| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.logs.query.transaction.threshold[`db.logs.query.transaction.threshold`]
| `0s`
a|
If the transaction is open for longer than this threshold (duration of time), the transaction is logged once completed, provided transaction logging is set to `INFO`.
Defaults to `0` seconds, which means all transactions are logged.
This can be useful when identifying where there is a significant time lapse after query execution and transaction commits, especially in performance analysis around locking.
|===

.Configure for simple query logging
====

In this example, the query logging is set to `INFO`, and all other query log parameters are at their defaults.

.Configure for query logging with more details
====

In this example, the query log is enabled, as well as some additional logging:

[source, properties, role="noheader"]
----
db.logs.query.enabled=INFO
db.logs.query.parameter_logging_enabled=true
db.logs.query.threshold=<appropriate value>
----

The following sample query is run on the Movies database:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(n1:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(n2:Person {name:"Tom Hanks"}) RETURN n1.title
----

The corresponding query log in _<.file>query.log_ is:

[source, plain format, role="noheader"]
----
2017-11-23 12:44:56.973+0000 INFO  1550 ms: (planning: 20, cpu: 920, waiting: 10) - 13792 B - 15 page hits, 0 page faults - bolt-session	bolt	neo4j	neo4j-javascript/1.4.1		client/127.0.0.1:58189	server/127.0.0.1:7687>	neo4j - match (n:Person {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(n1:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(n2:Person {name:"Tom Hanks"}) return n1.title; - {} - {}
----

An obvious but essential point of note when examining parameters of a particular query is to ensure you analyze only the entries relevant to that specific query plan, as opposed to, e.g., CPU, time, bytes, and so on for each log entry in sequence.

Following is a breakdown of resource usage parameters with descriptions corresponding to the above query:

`2017-11-23 12:44:56.973+0000`::
Log timestamp.

`INFO`::
Log category.

`1550 ms`::
Total elapsed cumulative wall time spent in query execution.
It is the total of planning time + CPU + waiting + any other processing time, e.g., taken to acquire execution threads.
This figure is cumulative for every time a CPU thread works on executing the query.

`Planning`::
Refers to the time the Cypher engine takes to create a query plan.
Plans may be cached for repetitive queries, and therefore, planning times for such queries will be shorter than those for previously unplanned ones.
In the example, this contributed 20ms to the total execution time of 1550ms.

`CPU time`::
Refers to the time taken by the individual threads executing the query, e.g., a query is submitted at 08:00.
It uses CPU for 720ms, but then the CPU swaps out to another query, so the first query is no longer using the CPU.
Then, after 100ms, it gets/uses the CPU again for 200ms (more results to be loaded, requested by the client via the Driver), then the query completes at 08:01:30, so the total duration is 1550ms (includes some round-trip time for 2 round-trips), and CPU is 720+200=920ms.

`Waiting`::
Time a query spent waiting before execution (in ms), for example, if an existing query has a lock which the new query must wait to release.
In the example, this contributed 10ms to the total execution time of 1550ms. +
It is important to note that the client requests data from the server only when its record buffer is empty (one round-trip from the server may end up with several records), and the server stops pushing data into outgoing buffers if the client does not read them in a timely fashion.
Therefore, it depends on the size of the result set.
If it is relatively small and fits in a single round-trip, the client receives all the results at once, and the server finishes processing without any client-side effect.
Meanwhile, if the result set is large, the client-side processing time will affect the overall time, as it is directly connected to when new data is requested from the server.

`13792 B`::
The logged allocated bytes for the executed queries.
This is the amount of HEAP memory used during the life of the query.
The logged number is cumulative over the duration of the query, i.e., for memory-intense or long-running queries, the value may be larger than the current memory allocation.

`15 page hits`::
Page hit means the result was returned from page cache as opposed to disk.
In this case, the page cache was hit 15 times.

`0 page faults`::
Page fault means that the query result data was not in the `dbms.memory.pagecache` and, therefore, had to be fetched from the file system.
In this case, query results were returned entirely from the 8 page cache hits mentioned above, so there were 0 hits on the disk required.

`bolt-session`::
The session type.

`bolt`::
The Browser <--> database communication protocol used by the query.

`neo4j`::
The process ID.

`neo4j-javascript/1.4.1`::
The Driver version.

`client/127.0.0.1:52935`::
The query client outbound `IP:port` used.

`server/127.0.0.1:7687>`::
The server listening `IP:port` used.

`neo4j`::
username of the query executioner

`match (n:Person {name:'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]→(n1:Movie)←[:DIRECTED]-(n2:Person {name:"Tom Hanks"}) return n1.title`::
The executed query.
+
The last two parenthesis `{}` `{}` are for the query parameters and `txMetaData`.

[[attach-metadata-tx]]
==== Attach metadata to a transaction

You can attach metadata to a transaction and have it printed in the query log using the built-in procedure xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_tx_setmetadata[`tx.setMetaData`].

[NOTE]
====
Neo4j Drivers also support attaching metadata to a transaction.
For more information, see the respective Driver's manual.
====

Every graph app should follow a convention for passing metadata with the queries that it sends to Neo4j:

[source, role=noheader]
----
{
  app: "neo4j-browser_v4.4.0", #<1>
  type: "system" #<2>
}
----
<1> `app` can be a user-agent styled-name plus version.
<2> `type` can be one of:
* `system` -- a query automatically run by the app.
* `user-direct` -- a query the user directly submitted to/through the app.
* `user-action` -- a query resulting from an action the user performed.
* `user-transpiled` -- a query that has been derived from the user input.

This is typically done programmatically but can also be used with the Neo4j dev tools. +
In general, you start a transaction on a user database and attach a list of metadata to it by calling `tx.setMetaData`.
You can also use the procedure xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_tx_getmetadata[`CALL tx.getMetaData()`] to show the metadata of the current transaction.
These examples use the MovieGraph dataset from the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current/visual-tour/#guides[Neo4j Browser guide].

.Using `cypher-shell`, attach metadata to a transaction
====

[NOTE]
====
Cypher Shell always adds metadata that follows the convention by default.
In this example, the defaults are overridden.

=== JSON format
The query log can use a JSON layout.
In order to change the format, the layout for the `QueryLogger` must be changed from using the `PatternLayout`:

[source%linenums,xml,options="nowrap",highlight=4]
----
<RollingRandomAccessFile name="QueryLog" fileName="${config:server.directories.logs}/query.log"
                     filePattern="${config:server.directories.logs}/query.log.%02i"
             createOnDemand="true">
    <PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ}{GMT+0} %-5p %m%n"/>
    <Policies>
        <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="20 MB"/>
    </Policies>
    <DefaultRolloverStrategy fileIndex="min" max="7"/>
</RollingRandomAccessFile>
----

to using the `JsonTemplateLayout`:

[source%linenums,xml,options="nowrap",highlight=4]
----
<RollingRandomAccessFile name="QueryLog" fileName="${config:server.directories.logs}/query.log"
                     filePattern="${config:server.directories.logs}/query.log.%02i"
             createOnDemand="true">
    <JsonTemplateLayout eventTemplateUri="classpath:org/neo4j/logging/QueryLogJsonLayout.json"/>
    <Policies>
        <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="20 MB"/>
    </Policies>
    <DefaultRolloverStrategy fileIndex="min" max="7"/>
</RollingRandomAccessFile>
----
