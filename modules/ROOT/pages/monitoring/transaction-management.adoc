[[transaction-management-transaction-timeout]]
== Configure transaction timeout

It is recommended to configure Neo4j to terminate transactions whose execution time has exceeded the configured timeout.

* Set `xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.transaction.timeout[dbms.transaction.timeout]` to some positive time interval value (e.g.,`10s`) denoting the default transaction timeout.
Setting `dbms.transaction.timeout` to `0` -- which is the default value -- disables the feature.

* You can also set this dynamically on each instance (Read Replicas only if required) using the procedure `dbms.setConfigValue('dbms.transaction.timeout','10s')`.

Set the timeout to ten seconds.

Configuring transaction timeout has no effect on transactions executed with custom timeouts (e.g., via the Java API or Neo4j Drivers), as the custom timeout overrides the value set for `dbms.transaction.timeout`.
Note that the timeout value can only be overridden to a value that is smaller than that configured by `dbms.transaction.timeout`.

The _transaction timeout_ feature is also known as the _transaction guard_.


[[transaction-management-lock-acquisition-timeout]]
== Configure lock acquisition timeout

An executing transaction may get stuck while waiting for some lock to be released by another transaction.
To kill that transaction and remove the lock, set set `xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.lock.acquisition.timeout[dbms.lock.acquisition.timeout]` to some positive time interval value (e.g., `10s`) denoting the maximum time interval within which any particular lock should be acquired, before failing the transaction.
Setting `dbms.lock.acquisition.timeout` to `0` -- which is the default value -- disables the lock acquisition timeout.

This feature cannot be set dynamically.

[[transaction-management-list-transactions]]
== List all running transactions

The procedure for viewing transactions, `dbms.listTransactions()`, is replaced by the command for showing transactions, `SHOW TRANSACTIONS`.
Both the command and procedure returns the transactions that are currently executing within the instance.

The link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/administration/access-control/database-administration#access-control-database-administration-transaction[`SHOW TRANSACTION` privilege] determines what transactions are returned by the command.
However, the xref:authentication-authorization/terminology.adoc#term-current-user[current user] can always view all of their own currently executing transactions.

*Syntax:*

`SHOW TRANSACTIONS`

For more information on this command, see the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/transaction-clauses#query-listing-transactions[Cypher manual -> `SHOW TRANSACTIONS` command].
