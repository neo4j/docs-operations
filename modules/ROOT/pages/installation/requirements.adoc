[[deployment-requirements]]
= System requirements
:description: This section provides an overview of the system requirements for running Neo4j in a production environment. 

Neo4j can be installed in many environments and for different scopes, therefore system requirements largely depends on the use of the software.
This section distinguishes between a personal/development installation, and a server-based installation.


[TIP]
====
*Neo4j AuraDB* is a fully managed Neo4j database, hosted in the cloud and requires no installation.
For more information, see the link:https://neo4j.com/aura/[AuraDB product page] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/current/[AuraDB documentation].

[[deployment-requirements-platforms]]
== Supported platforms

Neo4j is supported on systems with x86_64 and ARM64 architectures, whether they are a physical, virtual, or containerized environments.


[[deployment-requirements-hardware]]
== Hardware requirements

In terms of hardware requirements, follow these guidelines:

.Hardware requirement guidelines.
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| *CPU*     | Performance is generally memory or I/O bound for large graphs, and compute bound for graphs that fit in memory.
| *Memory*  | More memory allows for larger graphs, but it needs to be configured properly to avoid disruptive garbage collection operations.
| *Storage* | Aside from capacity, the performance characteristics of the disk are the most important when selecting storage:

* Neo4j workloads tend significantly toward random reads.
* Select media with low average seek time: SSD over spinning disks.
* Consult xref:performance/disks-ram-and-other-tips.adoc[Disks, RAM and other tips] for more details.

For personal use and software development:

.Hardware requirement guidelines for personal use and software development.
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| *CPU*     | Intel Core i3 minimum, Intel Core i7 recommended.
| *Memory*  | 2GB minimum, 16GB or more recommended.
| *Storage* | 10GB SATA Minimum, SSD with SATA Express or NVMe recommended.
|===

For cloud environments:

.Hardware requirement guidelines for cloud environments.
[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| *CPU*     | 2vCPU minimum, 16+ recommended, possibly Xeon processors.
| *Memory*  | 2GB minimum, size depends on workloads: in some cases, it is recommended to use instances with memory that fits the size of the graph in use.
| *Storage* | 10GB minimum block storage, attached NVMe SSD recommended.

Storage size depends on the size of the databases.
|===

For server-based, on-premise environments:

[cols="1,3a"]
|===
| *CPU*     | Intel Xeon processors.
| *Memory*  | 8GB minimum, size depends on workloads; in some cases, it is recommended to use instances with memory that fits the size of the graph in use.
| *Storage* | SATA i7.2K RPM 6Gbps Hard Drive minimum, NVMe SSD recommended.

Storage size depends on the size of the databases.

[[deployment-requirements-filesystem]]
== Filesystem

For proper ACID behavior, the filesystem must support flush (_fsync_, _fdatasync_).
See xref:performance/linux-file-system-tuning.adoc[Linux file system tuning] for a discussion on how to configure the filesystem in Linux for optimal performance.

[NOTE]
====
If  _tmp_ is set to `noexec`, it is recommended to set `dbms.jvm.additional=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/home/neo4j` in _conf/neo4j.conf_.
Additionally, replace _/home/neo4j_ with a path that has `exec` permissions.

For _/bin/cypher-shell_, set this via an environment variable: `export JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.io.tmpdir=/home/neo4j` and replace `/home/neo4j` with a path that has `exec` permissions.
====

[[deployment-requirements-java]]
== Java

It is required to have a pre-installed, compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM), to run a Neo4j instance.

.Neo4j version and JVM requirements.

|===
| Neo4j Version        | JVM compliance
