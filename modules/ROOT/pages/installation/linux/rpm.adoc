:description: How to deploy Neo4j using the Neo4j RPM package on Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux distributions.
[[linux-rpm]]
= Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, and Amazon Linux (.rpm)

You can deploy Neo4j on Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux distributions using the Neo4j RPM package.

[[linux-rpm-prerequisites]]
== Java prerequisites

Neo4j {neo4j-version} requires the Java 21 runtime.

=== OpenJDK Java 21
Most of our supported Linux distributions have OpenJDK Java 21 available by default.
Consequently, no extra setup is required if you are using OpenJDK Java, the correct Java dependency will be installed by the package manager when installing Neo4j.

=== Zulu JDK 21 or Corretto 21

If you want to use a non-default JDK, it must be installed before starting the Neo4j installation.
Otherwise, your package manager will install the default Java distribution for your operating system, usually OpenJDK.

Installation instructions can be found on the manufacturer's website:

* https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk[Zulu JDK]
* https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[Amazon Corretto JDK]


[[linux-rpm-install]]
== Install on Red Hat, CentOS or Amazon Linux


[[linux-rpm-install-standard]]
=== Set up the repository

. Import the Neo4j GPG public key into the systemâ€™s RPM keyring.
The key is required to verify the authenticity of the Neo4j packages you will install.
+
[source, bash]
----
rpm --import https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key
----

. Create a `neo4j.repo` file in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory.
This file contains the repository configuration for Neo4j.
+
[source, bash]
----
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/neo4j.repo
[neo4j]
name=Neo4j RPM Repository
baseurl=https://yum.neo4j.com/stable/latest
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
EOF
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading from Neo4j 5.x or earlier, you may need to clear the package manager cache before Neo4j packages become available:

`yum clean dbcache`
====

. Verify that the Neo4j repository is set up correctly by listing the available Neo4j packages versions:
+
[source, bash]
----
yum list neo4j --showduplicates
----

=== Install Neo4j

Install Neo4j as `root` using the following commands depending on which edition you are using:

* Community Edition
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
yum install neo4j-{neo4j-version-exact}
----

* Enterprise Edition
+
Accept either the commercial or the evaluation license agreement before running the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
The following are examples of using an interactive prompt and a non-interactive installation:
+
.Interactive installation of Enterprise Edition under the commercial license
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
yum install neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}
----
You have to choose either a link:https://legal.neo4j.com/[commercial license] or an link:https://neo4j.com/terms/enterprise_us/[evaluation license] before the interactive installation is allowed to complete.
+
For a non-interactive installation, you can set the environment variable `NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT` to `yes` (for the commercial license) or `eval` (for the evaluation license).
This should be done in the same line as the package is installed, to ensure bash correctly passes the environment variable to the installer process.
As in the following example:
+
.Non-interactive installation of Enterprise Edition under the commercial license
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes yum install neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}
----

[[linux-rpm-suse]]
== Install on SUSE

For SUSE-based distributions, the steps are as follows:

. Use the following as `root` to add the repository:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
zypper addrepo --refresh https://yum.neo4j.com/stable/latest neo4j-repository
----

. Install Neo4j as `root` using the following commands depending on which edition you are using:
+
* Community Edition
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
zypper install neo4j-{neo4j-version-exact}
----

* Enterprise Edition
+
Accept either the commercial or the evaluation license agreement before running the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
The following are examples of using an interactive prompt and a non-interactive installation:
+
.Interactive installation of Enterprise Edition under the commercial license
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
zypper install neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}
----
You have to choose either a link:https://legal.neo4j.com/[commercial license] or an link:https://neo4j.com/terms/enterprise_us/[evaluation license] before the interactive installation is allowed to complete.
+
For a non-interactive installation, you can set the `NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT` to `yes` (for the commercial license) or `eval` (for the evaluation license) as in the following example:
+
.Non-interactive installation of Enterprise Edition under the commercial license
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes zypper install neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}
----

[[linux-rpm-install-offline-installation]]
== Offline installation

If you cannot reach `\https://yum.neo4j.com/stable/{neo4j-version}` to install Neo4j using RPM, perhaps due to a firewall, you need to obtain Neo4j via an alternative machine that has the relevant access, and then move the RPM package manually.

[NOTE]
====
It is important to note that using this method means that the offline machine cannot receive the dependencies that are normally downloaded and installed automatically when using `yum` for installing Neo4j, xref:cypher-shell.adoc[Neo4j Cypher Shell], and Java.
====

. Download the Neo4j and Cypher Shell RPM installers from https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/[Deployment Center] or run the following to obtain the required packages:
+
* Cypher Shell:
+
[source, curl, subs="attributes"]
----
curl -O https://dist.neo4j.org/cypher-shell/cypher-shell-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm
----
* Neo4j Community Edition:
+
[source, curl, subs="attributes"]
----
curl -O https://dist.neo4j.org/rpm/neo4j-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm
----
* Neo4j Enterprise Edition:
+
[source, curl, subs="attributes"]
----
curl -O https://dist.neo4j.org/rpm/neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm
----

. Manually move the downloaded RPM packages to the offline machine.
Before installing Neo4j, you must manually install the required Java 21 packages.
+
. Install Neo4j and Cypher Shell as `root` using the following command depending on which edition you are using:
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading from Neo4j 5.x or earlier, due to strict dependencies between Neo4j and Cypher Shell both packages must be upgraded simultaneously.
This must be one single command, and Neo4j Cypher Shell must be the first package in the command.
====
+
* Community Edition
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
rpm --install cypher-shell-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm neo4j-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm
----
+
* Enterprise Edition
+
Accept either the commercial or the evaluation license agreement before running the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
The following example uses an interactive prompt:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
rpm --install cypher-shell-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm
----
You have to choose either a link:https://legal.neo4j.com/[commercial license] or an link:https://neo4j.com/terms/enterprise_us/[evaluation license] before the interactive installation is allowed to complete.
For a non-interactive installation, you can set the `NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT` to `yes` (for the commercial license) or `eval` (for the evaluation license) as in the following example:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes rpm --install cypher-shell-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}-1.noarch.rpm
----

[[rpm-service-start-automatically]]
== Start the Neo4j service automatically on system start

To enable Neo4j to start automatically on system boot, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
systemctl enable neo4j
----

[NOTE]
====
Before starting up the database for the first time, it is recommended to use the `set-initial-password` command of `neo4j-admin` to define the password for the native user `neo4j`.

If the password is not set explicitly using this method, it will be set to the default password `neo4j`.
In that case, you will be prompted to change the default password at first login.

For more information, see xref:configuration/set-initial-password.adoc[].
====

For more information on operating the Neo4j system service, see xref:installation/linux/systemd.adoc[Neo4j system service].

== Uninstall Neo4j

Follow these steps to uninstall Neo4j:

. (Optional) Create a xref:/backup-restore/index.adoc[backup] to avoid losing your data.
. Uninstall Neo4j:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo yum remove neo4j
