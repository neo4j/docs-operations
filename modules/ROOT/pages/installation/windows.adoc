:description: How to install Neo4j on Windows.
[[windows-installation]]
= Windows installation

Before you install Neo4j on Windows, check xref:installation/requirements.adoc[System Requirements] to see if your setup is suitable.
If it is not already installed, get link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886[OracleJDK 21] or link:https://www.azul.com/downloads/[ZuluJDK 21].

[[windows-console]]
== Install and start Neo4j

You can install Neo4j on Windows either by downloading and extracting a ZIP archive, by running it as a Windows service, or by using the Windows PowerShell module.

=== Install Neo4j using a zip archive

. Download the Windows Executable {neo4j-version-exact} (zip) release from link:{neo4j-download-center-uri}[Neo4j Deployment Center].
. Right-click the downloaded file and select *Extract All* to extract the contents of the archive.
. Place the extracted files in a permanent home on your server and set the environment variable `NEO4J_HOME` to point to the extracted directory, for example, `setx NEO4J_HOME "C:\neo4j\neo4j-<NEO4J_VERSION>"` to make it easier to refer to it later.
. (Recommended) xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc#file-locations-file-locations[Change the default locations] of the _data_, _conf_, _certificates_, _licenses_, and _plugins_ (if you plan to use custom plugins) directories by setting the environment variable `NEO4J_CONF` and the respective xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#_server_directories_settings[`server.directories.*`] settings to point to the desired locations.
+
[NOTE]
====
Storing your Neo4j files outside `NEO4J_HOME` will simplify the upgrade process later because you will be able to replace the DBMS binaries without affecting the configuration and state.
Otherwise, these Neo4j files will remain in the old installation folder and may be accidentally overwritten during an upgrade or deleted during a subsequent uninstall.
====
. label:enterprise[Enterprise Edition] Accept either the commercial or the evaluation license agreement.
If you are using Community Edition, you can skip this step.
* Use one of the following options to accept the commercial license agreement.
See the link:https://legal.neo4j.com/[Neo4j licensing] page for details on the available agreements.
** Set the environment variable `NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes`.
** Run `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j-admin server license --accept-commercial`
* Use one of the following options to accept the link:https://neo4j.com/terms/enterprise_us/[Neo4j Evaluation Agreement for Neo4j Software]:
** Set the environment variable `NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=eval`.
** Run `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j-admin server license --accept-evaluation`.
. Before starting up the database for the first time, it is recommended to use the `set-initial-password` command of `neo4j-admin` to define the password for the native user `neo4j`.
+
If the password is not set explicitly using this method, it will be set to the default password `neo4j`.
In that case, you will be prompted to change the default password at first login. +
For more information, see xref:configuration/set-initial-password.adoc[].
. Start Neo4j as a console application by running `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j console` in your command prompt.


[[windows-service]]
=== Install Neo4j as a Windows service

You can install Neo4j as a Windows service.

[WARNING]
====
By default, the Neo4j Windows service runs as the LocalSystem account, which has full access to the system.
This is a security risk, and it is recommended to run the service as a user without full LocalSystem privileges.
====

. Create a user account that the Neo4j service will run as using using services.msc, or the sc (Service Control) command.
You can use an existing user account, but it must have the `Log on as a service` right.
. Follow the steps in the <<_install_neo4j_using_a_zip_archive, Install Neo4j using a zip archive>> section to download and extract the ZIP archive and set up the environment variables.
. Run the following command in your command prompt to install the service:
+
[source, bash]
----
%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j windows-service install
----
. Start the Neo4j service by running `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j start`.

[NOTE]
====
When installing a new release of Neo4j, you must first run `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j windows-service uninstall` on any previously installed versions.
Then, install the new version using the `install` command as described above.
====

[[windows-update-service]]
=== Change the Neo4j Windows service configuration

When Neo4j is installed as a service, the Java options are stored in the service configuration file.
If you want to change any of these options or environment variables after the service is installed, you must update and restart the service for the changes to take effect.
For example, updating the value of `server.memory.heap.initial_size` in the default xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc[_neo4j.conf_] file or by using the `NEO4J_CONF` environment variable will not automatically apply the changes.
The service needs to be updated and restarted to pick them up.
To update the service, run ``%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j windows-service update`.
Then restart the service to run it with the new configuration.

The same applies to the path to where Java is installed on the system.
If the path changes, for example when upgrading to a new version of Java, it is necessary to run the `%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j windows-service update` command and restart the service.
Then, the new Java location will be used by the service.

.Update service example
====
. Install service
+
----
%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j windows-service install
----

. Change memory configuration
+
----
echo server.memory.heap.initial_size=8g >> conf\neo4j.conf
echo server.memory.heap.initial_size=16g >> conf\neo4j.conf
----

. Update service
+
----
%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j windows-service update
----

. Restart service
+
----
%NEO4J_HOME%\bin\neo4j restart

====

[[powershell]]
=== Install Neo4j using PowerShell

The Neo4j PowerShell module allows administrators to install, start, and stop Neo4j WindowsÂ® Services, as well as perform various administrative tasks using `Neo4j Admin` and `Cypher Shell`.
The PowerShell module is installed as part of the https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/[ZIP file] distributions of Neo4j.
It requires PowerShell 2.0 or later and is supported on 64-bit Windows operating systems.

. Unblock the downloaded Neo4j ZIP file if necessary to be able to import the module:
.. Right-click on the ZIP file and choose *Properties*. +
A dialog appears with an *Unblock* button.
.. Click the *Unblock* button to enable the import of the module.
.. Click *Apply* and then *OK* to close the dialog.
. Right-click the downloaded file and select *Extract All* to extract the contents of the archive.
. Run the following command from an elevated PowerShell prompt to enable script execution:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
----
+
For more information, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.5[About execution policies].
+
[NOTE]
====
The PowerShell module displays a warning if it detects that you do not have administrative rights.
====

. Set the environment variable `NEO4J_HOME` to point to the directory where you have installed Neo4j.
For example, you can run the following command in your PowerShell session, assuming you have installed Neo4j in `C:\Neo4j`:
+
[source,powershell]
----
$env:NEO4J_HOME = "C:\Neo4j"
----
. Import the Neo4j PowerShell module by running the following command:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Import-Module $env:NEO4J_HOME\bin\Neo4j-Management.psd1
----
+
This adds the module to the current session.

. Once the module is imported, you can start an interactive console version of a Neo4j Server:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Invoke-Neo4j console
----

[TIP]
====
To stop the server, use `Ctrl-C` in the console window, created by the command.
====


[[powershell-help]]
==== Inspect the module

. Get all available commands in the module by running the following command:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-Command -Module Neo4j-Management
----
+
The output should be similar to the following:
+
[source, shell, subs="attributes"]
----
CommandType  Name              Version    Source
-----------  ----              -------    ------

Function     Invoke-Neo4jAdmin 3.0.0      Neo4j-Management
----

. See what each command does by running the following command, replacing `<command-name>` with the name of the command you want to inspect, for example, `Invoke-Neo4j`:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Get-Help <command-name>
----

. Run the following to see some usage examples of that command:
+
[source,powershell]
----
