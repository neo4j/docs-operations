Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database.
The architecture is designed for optimal management, storage, and traversal of nodes and relationships.
The graph database takes a property graph approach, which is beneficial for both traversal performance and operations runtime.
Neo4j offers dedicated memory management and memory-efficient operations.

Neo4j is scalable and can be deployed as a standalone server or across multiple machines in a fault-tolerant cluster for production environments.
Other features for production applications include hot backups and extensive monitoring.

== Neo4j editions

There are two editions of self-managed Neo4j to choose from, the Community Edition (CE) and the Enterprise Edition (EE).
The Enterprise Edition includes all that Community Edition offers, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover capabilities.

Community Edition::
The Community Edition is a fully functional edition of Neo4j, suitable for single-instance deployments.
It fully supports key Neo4j features, such as ACID-compliant transactions, Cypher, and programming APIs.
It is ideal for learning Neo4j, do-it-yourself projects, and applications in small workgroups.


Enterprise Edition::
The Enterprise Edition extends the functionality of Community Edition to include key features for performance and scalability, such as a clustering architecture and online backup functionality.
Additional security features include role-based access control and LDAP support, for example, Active Directory.
It is the choice for production systems with requirements for scale and availability, such as commercial and critical internal solutions.

The following table compares the available key features in both editions:

[NOTE]
====
By default, Neo4j Community Edition and Neo4j Enterprise Edition report a small amount of usage data.
This helps Neo4j understand how its products are used and improve them.
For more information about what data is collected, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/usage-data/[Usage data report].
====

[[versioning]]
== Neo4j server versions

2025.01.0 introduces a new calendar versioning (CalVer) for the Neo4j server instead of the previously used semantic versioning (SemVer).
The new versioning format, *YYYY.MM.Patch*, is based on the year and month of the release, for example, 2025.01.0, 2025.02.0, and so on.
The patch number is incremented for each release within the same month.

Some of the releases will be designated as long-term support (LTS) releases.

link:{aura-uri}[Neo4j Aura] always uses the latest version of the Neo4j server.

include::partial$/cypher-versions.adoc[]

== Operations Manual versioning

The Operations Manual is versioned according to the calendar version of the Neo4j server.
For example, the Operations Manual for Neo4j 2025.01.0 is versioned as 2025.01.0 and reflects the features and changes in that release.
