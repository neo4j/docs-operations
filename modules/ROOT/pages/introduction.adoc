Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database.
The architecture is designed for optimal management, storage, and traversal of nodes and relationships.
The graph database takes a property graph approach, which is beneficial for both traversal performance and operations runtime.
Neo4j offers dedicated memory management and memory-efficient operations.

Neo4j is scalable and can be deployed as a standalone server or across multiple machines in a fault-tolerant cluster for production environments.
Other features for production applications include hot backups and extensive monitoring.

== Neo4j editions

There are two editions of self-managed Neo4j to choose from, the Community Edition (CE) and the Enterprise Edition (EE).
The Enterprise Edition includes all that Community Edition offers, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover capabilities.

Community Edition::
The Community Edition is a fully functional edition of Neo4j, suitable for single-instance deployments.
It fully supports key Neo4j features, such as ACID-compliant transactions, Cypher, and programming APIs.
It is ideal for learning Neo4j, do-it-yourself projects, and applications in small workgroups.


Enterprise Edition::
The Enterprise Edition extends the functionality of Community Edition to include key features for performance and scalability, such as a clustering architecture and online backup functionality.
Additional security features include role-based access control and LDAP support, for example, Active Directory.
It is the choice for production systems with requirements for scale and availability, such as commercial and critical internal solutions.

The following table compares the available key features in both editions:

[[versioning]]
== Versioning

Neo4j uses semantic versioning (link:{semver-uri}[Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0]).
Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, the increment is based on:

* `MAJOR` version - incompatible API changes towards previous `MAJOR` version.
* `MINOR` version - functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
* `PATCH` release - backwards compatible bug fixes.

Neo4j’s fully managed cloud service link:{aura-uri}[Neo4j Aura] uses only `MAJOR` versioning.
