= Querying using Composite databases

:description: Example queries that show how to perform a range of different tasks on Composite databases.


//Make an image that sets up the example?
//The query examples assume that we have a setup similar to that in <<example-create-a-single-instance-fabric-setup>>.

The examples featured in this section make use of the two Cypher clauses: link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/use[`USE`] and link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/call-subquery[`CALL {}`].

[[composite-databases-queries-graph-selection]]
== Graph selection

Queries submitted to a Composite database may contain several `USE` clauses that direct different parts of the query to different constituent graphs.

Each constituent graph is named after the alias that introduces it into the Composite database.

The examples assume the same setup as the one created in xref:composite-databases/administration.adoc[].
[[composite-databases-queries-single-graph]]
=== Query a single graph

.Reading and returning data from a single graph
====
[source, cypher]
----
USE cineasts.latest
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title
----
====

The `USE` clause at the beginning of the query selects the `cineasts.latest` graph for all the subsequent clauses.
`MATCH` is performed on that graph.

[[composite-databases-queries-multiple-graphs]]
=== Query multiple graphs

.Reading and returning data from two graphs
====
[source, cypher]
----
USE cineasts.latest
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title
  UNION
USE cineasts.upcoming
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title
----
====

The first part of the `UNION` query selects the `cineasts.latest` graph and the second part selects the `cineasts.upcoming` graph.


[[composite-databases-queries-dynamic-graphs]]
=== Dynamic graph access

Queries can also select constituent graphs dynamically, using the form `USE graph.byName(graphName)`.

.Reading and returning data from dynamically selected graphs
====
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND ['cineasts.latest', 'cineasts.upcoming'] AS graphName
CALL {
  USE graph.byName(graphName)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie
}
RETURN movie.title AS title
----
====
In the example above, the part of the query accessing graph data, `MATCH (movie:Movie)`, is wrapped in a sub-query with a dynamic `USE` clause.
`UNWIND` is used to get the names of our graphs, each on one row.
The `CALL {}` sub-query executes once per input row.
In this case, once selecting `cineasts.latest`, and once selecting `cineasts.upcoming`.

[[composite-databases-queries-listing-graphs]]
=== Listing graphs

The built-in function link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions/query-functions#functions-graph-names[`graph.names()`] returns a list containing the names of all constituent graphs on the current Composite database.

.The `graph.names()` function
====
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND graph.names() AS graphName
RETURN graphName
----
----
+---------------------+
| graphName           |
+---------------------+
| "cineasts.latest"   |
| "cineasts.upcoming" |
+---------------------+
----
====

The names returned by this function can be used for dynamic graph access.

.Reading and returning data from all graphs
====
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND graph.names() AS graphName
CALL {
  USE graph.byName(graphName)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie
}
RETURN movie.title
----
====

[[composite-databases-queries-result-aggregation]]
=== Query result aggregation

.Getting the earliest release year of all movies from all graphs

====
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND graph.names() AS graphName
CALL {
  USE graph.byName(graphName)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie.released AS released
}
RETURN min(released) AS earliest
----
====

The sub-query returns the `released` property of each movie, from each constituent graph.
The `RETURN` at the end of the main query aggregates across the full result to calculate the global minimum.


[[composite-databases-queries-correlated-subquery]]
=== Correlated subqueries

This query finds all movies in `cineasts.upcoming` that are to be released in the same month as the longest movie in `cineasts.latest`.

.Correlated subquery
====
[source, cypher]
----
CALL {
  USE cineasts.latest
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie.releasedMonth AS monthOfLongest
    ORDER BY movie.runningTime DESC
    LIMIT 1
}
CALL {
  USE cineasts.upcoming
  WITH monthOfLongest
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  WHERE movie.releasedMonth = monthOfLongest
  RETURN movie
}
RETURN movie
----
====

The first part of the query finds the movie with the longest running time from `cineasts.latest`, and returns its release month.
The second part of the query finds all movies in `cineasts.upcoming` that fulfill our condition and returns them.
The sub-query imports the `monthOfLongest` variable using `WITH monthOfLongest`, to make it accessible.

[[composite-databases-queries-updates]]
=== Updates

Composite database queries can perform updates to constituent graphs.

.Constituent graph update
====
[source, cypher]
----
USE cineasts.upcoming
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'Dune: Part Two'})
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Updates can only be performed on a single constituent graph per transaction.
====

.Multi-graph update will fail
====
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND graph.names() AS graphName
CALL {
  USE graph.byName(graphName)
  CREATE (:Movie {title: 'The Flash'})
}
----
----
Writing to more than one database per transaction is not allowed.
----
====

[[composite-databases-queries-limitations]]
=== Limitations

Queries on Composite databases have a few limitations.

==== Graph accessing operations

Consider a Composite database query:
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND graph.names() AS graphName
CALL {
  USE graph.byName(graphName)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie
}
RETURN movie
----
Here the outer clauses, i.e. the `UNWIND`, the `CALL` itself, and the final `RETURN`, appear in the root scope of the query, without a specifically chosen graph.
Clauses or expressions in scopes where no graph has been specified must not be graph-accessing.

The following Composite database query is invalid because `[p=(movie)-->() | p] AS paths` is a graph-accessing operation in the root scope of the query:

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND graph.names() AS graphName
CALL {
  USE graph.byName(graphName)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie
}
RETURN [p=(movie)-->() | p] AS paths
----

See examples of graph-accessing operations:

- `RETURN 1 + 2 AS number`
- `WITH node.property AS val`

==== Nested `USE` clauses

An inner scope must use the same graph as its outer scope:

[source, cypher]
----
USE cineasts.latest
MATCH (n)
CALL {
  USE cineasts.upcoming
  MATCH (m)
  RETURN m
}
RETURN n, m
----
----
Nested subqueries must use the same graph as their parent query.
Attempted to access graph cineasts.upcoming
"    USE cineasts.upcoming"
     ^
----

Sub-queries without a `USE` clause can be nested.
They inherit the specified graph from the outer scope.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL {
  USE cineasts.upcoming
  CALL {
    MATCH (m:Movie)
    RETURN m
  }
  RETURN m
}
RETURN m
----

== Cypher runtime

When a query is submitted to a Composite database, different parts of the query may run using different runtimes.
Clauses or expressions in scopes where no graph has been specified run using the _slotted_ runtime.
Parts of the query directed to different constituent graphs are run using the default runtime for that graph, or respect the submitted link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/query-tuning/query-options/#cypher-runtime[Cypher query options] if specified.

[[composite-databases-queries-built-in-functions]]
== Built-in graph functions

Graph functions are located in the namespace `graph`.
The following table describes these functions:

.Built-in graph functions
[options="header", cols="m,"]
|===
| Function
| Explanation
| graph.names()
| Provides a list of names of all constituent graphs on the current Composite database.
| graph.byName(graphName)
| Used with the `USE` clause to select a constituent graph by name dynamically.
  This function is supported only with `USE` clauses.
| graph.propertiesByName(graphName)
| Returns a map containing the properties associated with the given graph.
