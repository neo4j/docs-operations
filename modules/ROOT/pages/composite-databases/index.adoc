:description: This section describes administration and operation of composite databases. 

Fabric technology is used to improve the setting and management of sharded and federated databases with dynamic compositions of databases.
Composite databases is a new surface to administer Fabric databases, and was introduced in Neo4j v5.0.

Composite databases are administered via Cypher commands, replacing the Fabric configuration settings in earlier releases.
