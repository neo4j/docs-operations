:description: Examples of Cypher queries and commands that can be used with Neo4j Fabric. 


In this section we will look at a few example queries that show how to perform a range of different tasks.
//Make an image that sets up the example?
//The query examples assume that we have a setup similar to that in <<example-create-a-single-instance-fabric-setup>>.

The examples in this section make use of the two Cypher clauses: `USE` and `CALL {}`.
The syntax is explained in detail in the Cypher Manual:

* See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/call-subquery[Cypher Manual -> CALL {}] for details about the `CALL {}` clause.
* See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/use[Cypher Manual -> USE] for details about the `USE` clause.


[[fabric-query-single-graph]]
== Query a single graph

.Reading and returning data from a single graph.
====

[source, cypher]
----
USE example.graphA
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title
----
====

The `USE` clause at the beginning of the query causes the rest of the query to execute against the `example.graphA` graph.


[[fabric-query-multiple-graphs]]
== Query multiple graphs

.Reading and returning data from two named graphs
====

[source, cypher]
----
USE example.graphA
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title
  UNION
USE example.graphB
MATCH (movie:Movie)
RETURN movie.title AS title
----
====

The first part of the `UNION` query executes against the `example.graphA` graph and the second part executes against the `example.graphB` graph.


[[fabric-query-all-graphs]]
== Query all graphs

.Reading and returning data from all graphs
====

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND example.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE example.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie.title AS title
}
RETURN title
----
====
We call the built-in function `example.graphIds()` to get the graph IDs for all remote graphs in our Fabric setup.
We `UNWIND` the result of that function to get one record per graph ID. The `CALL {}` subquery is executed once per incoming record.
We use a `USE` clause in the subquery with a dynamic graph lookup, causing the subquery to execute once against each remote graph.
At the end of the main query we simply `RETURN` the title variable.


[[fabric-query-result-aggregation]]
== Query result aggregation

.Getting the earliest release year of all movies in all graphs

====

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND example.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE example.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN movie.released AS released
}
RETURN min(released) AS earliest
----
====

From each remote graph we return the released property of each movie.
At the end of the main query we aggregate across the full result to calculate the global minimum.


[[fabric-correlated-subquery]]
== Correlated subquery

.Correlated subquery
====
Assume that `graphA` contains American movies and `graphB` contains European movies.
Find all European movies released in the same year as the latest released American movie:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL {
  USE example.graphA
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  RETURN max(movie.released) AS usLatest
}
CALL {
  USE example.graphB
  WITH usLatest
  MATCH (movie:Movie)
  WHERE movie.released = usLatest
  RETURN movie
}
RETURN movie
----
====

We query the `example.graphA` and return the release year of the latest release.
We then query the `example.graphB`.
`WITH usLatest` is an import clause which lets us refer to the `usLatest` variable inside the subquery.
We find all the movies in this graph that fulfill our condition and return them.

It is not possible to switch the current graph in a nested query.
For example, the following query is illegal:

.Illegal correlated subquery
====
[source, cypher]
----
USE example.graphA
MATCH (movie:Movie)
WITH movie.title AS title
CALL {
  USE example.graphB // Cannot swicth from example.graphA
  WITH title
  MATCH (otherMovie:Movie)
  WHERE otherMovie.title STARTS WITH title
  RETURN otherMovie.title AS otherTitle
}
RETURN title, otherTitle
----
====

This limitation can be circumvented by having subqueries after one another, but without nesting them.

[[fabric-updating-query]]
== Updating query

.Create a new movie node

====

[source, cypher]
----
USE example.graphB
CREATE (m:Movie)
SET m.title = ‘Léon: The Professional’
SET m.tagline = ‘If you want the job done right, hire a professional.’
SET m.released = 1994
----
====


[[fabric-query-mapping-functions]]
== Mapping functions

Mapping functions are a common Fabric usage pattern.
In the previous examples, graphs were identified by providing static graph names in the query.
Fabric may be used in scenarios where graphs are identified by a mapping mechanism that can, for example, identify a key of an object contained in a graph. This can be achieved by using user-defined functions or other functions that may be already available. These functions ultimately return the ID of a graph in Fabric.

Mapping functions are commonly used in sharding scenarios. In Fabric, shards are associated to graphs, hence mapping functions are used to identify a graph, i.e. a shard.

[NOTE]
Refer to link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/java-reference/{page-version}/extending-neo4j/functions#extending-neo4j-functions[Java Reference -> User-defined functions] for details on how to create user-defined functions.

Let’s assume that Fabric is setup in order to store and retrieve data associated to nodes with the label `user`. User nodes are partitioned in several graphs (shards) in Fabric.
Each `user` has a numerical `userId`, which is unique in all Fabric.
We decide on a simple scheme where each `user` is located on a graph determined by taking the `userId` modulo the number of graphs.
We create a link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/java-reference/{page-version}/extending-neo4j/functions#extending-neo4j-functions[user-defined function] which implements the following pseudo code:

`sharding.userIdToGraphId(userId) = userId % NUM_SHARDS`

Assuming we have supplied a query parameter `$userId` with the specific userId that we are interested in, we use our function in this way:

[source, cypher]

----
USE example.graph( sharding.userIdToGraphId($userId) )
MATCH (u:User) WHERE u.userId = $userId
RETURN u
----


[[fabric-built-in-functions]]
== Fabric built-in functions

Fabric functions are located in a namespace corresponding to a Fabric database in which they are used.
The following table provides a description of Fabric built-in functions:

.Fabric built-in functions
[options="header", cols="m,"]
|===
| Function
| Explanation
| <fabric database name>.graphIds()
| Provides a list of IDs of all remote graph configured for the given Fabric database.
| <fabric database name>.graph(graphId)
| Maps a graph ID to a Graph.
  It accepts a graph ID as a parameter and returns a graph representation accepted by USE clause.
  This function is supported only in `USE` clauses
|===
