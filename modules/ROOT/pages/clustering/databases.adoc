[[database-management]]
= Managing databases in a cluster

The number of both primary and secondary servers to host a database can be set when the database is created and altered after creation.
The command `CREATE DATABASE` can be used to specify the initial topology and `ALTER DATABASE` can be used to change the topology once the database is created.
If a database is no longer needed, the command `DROP DATABASE` deletes the database from the cluster.

[[create-database]]
== `CREATE DATABASE`

The command to create a database in a cluster is not significantly different from the command to create a database in a non-clustered environment (see xref:database-administration/standard-databases/create-databases.adoc[Create, start, and stop databases] for more information on database management on single servers).
The difference in a clustered environment is that the topology can be specified, i.e. how many primaries and secondaries are desired for the database.
To create a database `foo` with 3 servers hosting the database in primary mode and 2 servers in secondary mode, the command looks like this:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE foo TOPOLOGY 3 PRIMARIES 2 SECONDARIES
----

The command can only be executed successfully if the cluster's servers are able to satisfy the specified topology.
If they are not, the command results in an error.
For example, if the cluster's servers are set up with mode constraints to contain two primaries and three secondaries, or if only four servers exist, the command fails with an error.

[NOTE]
====
If `TOPOLOGY` is not specified, the database is created according to `initial.dbms.default_primaries_count` and `initial.dbms.default_secondaries_count` specified in _neo4j.conf_.
After cluster startup, these values can be overwritten using the `dbms.setDefaultAllocationNumbers` procedure.
====
[NOTE]
====
A `CREATE DATABASE` command allocates the database, therefore there is no requirement to execute `REALLOCATE DATABASES` (described in xref:clustering/servers.adoc#_hosting_databases_on_added_servers[Hosting databases on added servers]).
However, over time, or after several `CREATE DATABASE` commands have been issued, the distribution of databases can become unbalanced.
At this point you can run `REALLOCATE DATABASES` to make the cluster re-balance databases across all servers that are part of the cluster.
====

[[alter-database]]
== `ALTER DATABASE`

To alter the topology of or read/write access to a database after it has been created, use the command `ALTER DATABASE`.

[[alter-topology]]
=== Alter database topology

To change the topology of the database `foo` from the previous example, the command can look like this:

[source, cypher]
----
ALTER DATABASE foo SET TOPOLOGY 2 PRIMARIES 1 SECONDARY
----

Like the `CREATE DATABASE` command, this command results in an error if the cluster does not contain sufficient servers to satisfy the requested topology.

Additionally, `ALTER DATABASE` is optionally idempotent and also results in an error if the database does not exist.
It is possible to append the command with `IF EXISTS` to make sure that no error is returned if the database does not exist.

When there is more than one possible permutation of the specified topology, Neo4j uses an allocator to decide how to spread the database across the cluster.
Note, like `CREATE DATABASE`, the `ALTER DATABASE` command allocates the database and there is no requirement to execute `REALLOCATE DATABASES` unless there is a desire to re-balance databases across all servers that are part of the cluster.

This normally happens when the cluster is configured with more servers than the sum of the number of primaries and secondaries for any one database.

It is not possible to automatically transition to a topology with a single primary host. Attempting to do so results in an error.

However, it is possible to _manually_ do this transition.
The first step is to back up the database, see xref:backup-restore/index.adoc[Backup and restore] for more information.
Once the database is backed up, the next step is to drop the database, see xref:database-administration/standard-databases/delete-databases.adoc[Delete databases] for more information.
The last step is to either seed a cluster from the backup with the new topology, or to restore the backup on a single server.
See xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed[Seed a cluster] further on for information on seeding.

Also, it is possible to automatically transition _from_ a topology with a single primary host to multiple primary hosts.
Keep in mind that during such a transition, the database will be unavailable for a short period of time.

`ALTER DATABASE` commands are optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to fail with an error if the database does not exist.
Appending `IF EXISTS` to the command ensures that no error is returned and nothing happens should the database not exist.

If the `ALTER DATABASE` command decreases the number of allocations of a database, allocations on xref:clustering/servers.adoc#_cordoned_servers[cordoned servers] are removed first.

// The allocation approach can be specified with the setting `initial.dbms.database_allocator`.
// The available options are:
//
// * `EQUAL_NUMBERS`
// * `OPTIMAL_DISC_USAGE`
// * `ALL`

[[alter-access]]
=== Alter database access

To alter the access to the database `foo`, the syntax looks like this:

[source, cypher]
----
ALTER DATABASE foo SET ACCESS {READ ONLY | READ WRITE}
----

By default, a newly created database has both read and write access.

[role=label--new-5.23]
[[deallocate-databases]]
== Deallocate databases

To relieve the load of a specific server(s), you can use one of the following procedures to deallocate databases causing the pressure from the server(s):

* xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_deallocateDatabaseFromServer[`dbms.cluster.deallocateDatabaseFromServer("server-name", "database-name")`]
* xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_deallocateDatabaseFromServers[`dbms.cluster.deallocateDatabaseFromServers(["server-name1", "server-name2"\], "database-name")`]
* xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_deallocateNumberOfDatabases[`dbms.cluster.deallocateNumberOfDatabases("server-name", number)`]

[NOTE]
====
You must have the `SERVER MANAGEMENT` privilege to execute these procedures.
====

For example, `server01` hosts two small databases, `foo` and `bar`, and one very large database `baz`, while other servers contain fewer or smaller databases, and `server01` is under pressure.

You can use one of the following approaches to deallocate `baz` from `server01` or to deallocate a number of databases from `server01`:

.Deallocating a database from a server
[source, cypher]
----
// With dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.deallocateDatabaseFromServer("server01", "baz", true);

// Without dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.deallocateDatabaseFromServer("server01", "baz");

----

.Deallocating a database from multiple servers
[source, cypher]
----
// With dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.deallocateDatabaseFromServers(["server01", "server02"], "baz", true);

// Without dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.deallocateDatabaseFromServers(["server01", "server02"], "baz");

----

.Deallocating three databases from a server
[source, cypher]
----
// With dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.deallocateNumberOfDatabases("server01", 3, true);

// Without dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.deallocateNumberOfDatabases("server01", 3);
----


[[reallocate-databases]]
== Reallocate databases

To rebalance all database allocations across the cluster, for example, because you added new servers, use either procedures or Cypher commands to reallocate databases onto the new servers.

[role=label--new-5.23]
[[reallocate-databases-procedure]]
=== Reallocate databases using a procedure

You can use the procedure xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_reallocateDatabase[`dbms.cluster.reallocateDatabase`] to rebalance a specific database across the cluster, or xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_reallocateNumberOfDatabases[`dbms.cluster.reallocateNumberOfDatabases`] to rebalance a number of database allocations across the cluster and relieve overloaded servers.
Note that if the cluster is already balanced, no reallocations will happen when running these procedures.
These procedures do not require a server name and can be executed with or without a dry run.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the `SERVER MANAGEMENT` privilege to execute these procedures.
====

For example, you add three new servers and want to move a very large database, `baz`, from all the servers containing it to the new servers.

.Reallocate one database to new servers
[source, cypher]
----
// With dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.reallocateDatabase("baz", true);

// Without dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.reallocateDatabase("baz");
----

.Reallocating a number of databases to new servers
[source, cypher]
----
// With dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.reallocateNumberOfDatabases(3, true);

// Without dry run
neo4j@system> CALL dbms.cluster.reallocateNumberOfDatabases(3);
----

[[reallocate-databases-cypher]]
=== Reallocate databases using a Cypher command

You can use the Cypher command `REALLOCATE DATABASES` to rebalance all database allocations across the cluster and relieve overloaded servers.
This command can also be used with `DRYRUN` to preview the new allocation of databases.

[CAUTION]
====
`REALLOCATE DATABASES` on a large cluster with many databases has the potential to move a lot of allocations at once, which might stress the cluster.
Consider starting with more limited reallocations, such as xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_reallocateNumberOfDatabases[`dbms.cluster.reallocateNumberOfDatabases`] with a small number, and let the databases complete their reallocation before calling it again, until no more reallocations are necessary.
====

[NOTE]
====
`DRYRUN` is available from Neo4j 5.2 and later.
====

[source,cypher]
----
neo4j@neo4j> DRYRUN REALLOCATE DATABASES;

[[recreate-databases]]
== Recreate a database

Neo4j 5.24 introduces the xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_cluster_recreateDatabase[`dbms.cluster.recreateDatabase()`] procedure, which allows you:

* To change the database store to a specified backup, while keeping all the associated privileges for the database.

* To make your database write-available again after it has been lost (for example, due to a disaster).
// See xref:clustering/disaster-recovery.adoc[] for more information.
 
[CAUTION]
====
The recreate procedure works only for real user databases and not for composite databases, or the `system` database.

Remember that the recreate procedure results in downtime while the stores get updated.
The time is unbounded and may depend on different factors -- for example, the size of the store, network speed, etc.
====

The database in question can be in an `online` or `offline` state when it is recreated, but a successful operation starts the database regardless of its previous state.

If your database has Change Data Capture (CDC) enabled, the CDC chain will stop when the database is recreated, even though CDC remains enabled in the recreated database.
To restore CDC functionality, follow the guide on how link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cdc/current/existing-databases/[to initialize CDC applications from an existing database].

Before recreating a database, any eventual quarantined states need to be addressed.
For more information, see xref:database-administration/standard-databases/errors.adoc#quarantine[Standard databases -> Error handling].

You need xref:authentication-authorization/dbms-administration.adoc#access-control-dbms-administration-database-management[the `CREATE DATABASE` and `DROP DATABASE` privileges] to run the recreate procedure.

To check if the recreation is successful, use the `SHOW DATABASES` command and verify that all allocations have been started.

Additionally, you have the option to modify <<alter-topology-recreate, the topology>> during the recreation process.
However, note that the store format, access, and enrichment cannot be altered during recreation.

[[recreate-seeding-options]]
=== Seeding options

The store to be used during the recreation of a database can be defined in different ways.
One method uses a backup, while others use available allocations in the cluster.

You can use either <<uri-seed, `seedURI`>> or <<seed-servers, `seedingServers`>> to specify the source from which the database should be recreated.

* If you define neither, an error is thrown.

* If you define both of them, then `seedingServers` must be an empty list.
See <<undefined-servers-backup, Undefined servers with fallback backup>> for more details.

* If `seedingServers` is not empty and `seedURI` is also defined, an error will occur.

[[uri-seed]]
==== Use backup as a seed

If you provide a URI to a backup or a dump, the stores on all allocations will be replaced by the backup or the dump at the given URI.
The new allocations can be put on any `ENABLED` server in the cluster.
See <<cluster-seed-uri, Seed from URI>> for more details.


[source, shell]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.recreateDatabase("neo4j", {seedURI: "s3:/myBucket/myBackup.backup"});
----

[[seed-servers]]
==== Use available servers as a seed

After the recreation is complete, the database will have the latest data store from the seeding servers.

[CAUTION]
====
Recreation is based on remaining stores or a store defined by the user.
This means that stores which were lost or not defined are not used for the recreation.
If not used stores were more up to date than the used ones, this results in data loss.
====

[[specified-servers]]
===== Specified servers

You can specify a set of available servers.
The stores on all allocations will be synchronized to the most up-to-date store from the defined servers.
The number of defined servers cannot exceed the number of total allocations in the desired topology. 

[source, shell]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.recreateDatabase("neo4j", {seedingServers: ["serverId1", "serverId2", "serverId3"]});
----

[[undefined-servers]]
===== Undefined servers

If you provide an empty list of seeding servers and do not specify a `seedURI`, Neo4j automatically selects all available allocations of the database as seeders.
The store will be replaced by the most up-to-date seeder available in the cluster.

[source, shell]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.recreateDatabase("neo4j", {seedingServers: []});
----

[[undefined-servers-backup]]
===== Undefined servers with fallback backup

If both an empty list of seeding servers and a `seedURI` are provided, Neo4j finds all available allocations of the database and use those as seeders.
However, if no available servers can be found, the database is recreated based on the backup or the dump defined by the URI.
This means the store is replaced by the most up-to-date seeder if available; otherwise, the backup is used.

[source, shell]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.recreateDatabase("neo4j", {seedingServers: [], seedURI: "s3:/myBucket/myBackup.backup"});
----

[[alter-topology-recreate]]
=== Change the topology

There is an option to define a new topology when recreating a database.
This can be beneficial during a disaster, if enough servers are not available to recreate the database with the original topology.
When altering the total number of allocations down during a recreation, it is important to remember that the number of seeding servers cannot exceed the number of total allocations of the database.
This also holds true when using recreate with an empty list of seeders.
If there are more available servers in the cluster hosting the database than the number of new allocations, the recreation will fail. 

[source, shell]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.recreateDatabase("neo4j", {seedingServers: [], primaries: 3, secondaries: 0});
----

[[cluster-seed]]
== Seed a cluster

There are two different ways to seed a cluster with data.
The first option is to use a _designated seeder_, where a designated server is used to create a backed-up database on other servers in the cluster.
The other options is to seed the cluster from URI, where all servers to host a database are seeded with an identical seed from an external source specified by the URI.
Keep in mind that using a designated seeder can be problematic in some situations as it is not known in advance how a database is going to be allocated to the servers in a cluster.
Also, this method relies on the seed already existing on one of the servers.


[[cluster-designated-seeder]]
=== Designated seeder

In order to designate a server in the cluster as a seeder, a database backup is transferred to that server using the xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database restore`] command.
Subsequently, that server is used as the source for other cluster members to copy the backed-up database from.

This example creates a user database called `foo`, hosted on three servers in primary mode.
The `foo` database *should not* previously exist on any of the servers in the cluster.

If a database with the same name as your backup already exists, use the command `DROP DATABASE` to delete it and all users and roles associated with it.

. Restore the `foo` database on one server.
In this example, the `server01` member is used.
+
[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database restore --from-path=/path/to/foo-backup-dir foo
----
. Find the server ID of `server01` by logging in to Cypher Shell and running `SHOW SERVERS`.
Cross-reference the address to find the server ID.
Use any database to connect.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----
In this case, the address for `server01` is `localhost:7687` and thus, the server ID is `8512c9b9-d9e8-48e6-b037-b15b0004ca18`.
+
. On one of the servers, use the `system` database and create the database `foo` using the server ID of `server01`.
The topology of `foo` is stored in the `system` database and when you create it, it is allocated according to the default topology (which can be shown with `CALL dbms.showTopologyGraphConfig`).
This may be different from the topology of `foo` when it was backed up.
If you want to ensure a certain allocation across the cluster, you can specify the desired topology with the `TOPOLOGY` clause in the `CREATE DATABASE` command.
See <<#_create_database, `CREATE DATABASE`>> for more information.

----

[[cluster-seed-uri]]
=== Seed from URI

This method seeds all servers with an identical seed from an external source, specified by the URI.
The seed can be either a backup or a dump from an existing database.
The sources of seeds are called _seed providers_.

The mechanism is pluggable, allowing new sources of seeds to be supported (see link:https://www.neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/project-setup/#extending-neo4j-plugin-seed-provider[Java Reference -> Implement custom seed providers] for more information).
The product has built-in support for seed from a mounted file system (file), FTP server, HTTP/HTTPS server and Amazon S3.

[NOTE]
====
S3 is supported by default, but the other providers require configuration of xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.databases.seed_from_uri_providers[`dbms.databases.seed_from_uri_providers`].
Neo4j 5 comes bundled with necessary libraries for AWS S3 connectivity and thus, `aws cli` is not required.
====

The `URLConnectionSeedProvider` supports the following:

** file:
** ftp:
** http:
** https:
** URIs

Accordingly, the `S3SeedProviders` supports:

** S3:
** URIs

The URI of the seed is specified when the `CREATE DATABASE` command is issued:

[source, cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE DATABASE foo OPTIONS {existingData: 'use', seedURI:'s3://myBucket/myBackup.backup'}
----

Download and validation of the seed is only performed as the new database is started.
If it fails, the database is not available and it has the `statusMessage`: `Unable to start database` of the `SHOW DATABASES` command.

[source, cypher, role="noplay"]
----
neo4j@neo4j> SHOW DATABASES;
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name    | type       | aliases | access       | address          | role      | writer | requestedStatus | currentStatus | statusMessage                                            | default | home  | constituents |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

To determine the cause of the problem, it is recommended to look at the `debug.log`.

Certain seed providers, such as S3, may require additional configuration.
This is specified with the `seedConfig` option.
This option expects a comma-separated list of configurations.
Each configuration value is specified as a name followed by `=` and the value, as such:

[source, cypher, role="noplay"]
----
CREATE DATABASE foo OPTIONS { existingData: 'use', seedURI: 's3:/myBucket/myBackup.backup’, seedConfig: 'region=eu-west-1' }
----

The available configuration options are:

* `file:`
* `ftp:`
* `http:`
* `https:`
* `s3:` - use this to specify the path to your S3 bucket.
For example, `seedURI: 's3:/myBucket/myBackup.backup'`
* `region:` - use this together with `s3:` to set the AWS region that hosts the S3 bucket.
For example, `seedConfig: 'region=eu-west-1'`.

Some seed providers may also want to pass credentials into the provider.
These are specified with the `seedCredentials` option.
Seed credentials are securely passed from the Cypher command to each server hosting the database.
For this to work, Neo4j on each server in the cluster must be configured with identical keystores.
This is identical to the configuration required by remote aliases, see xref:database-administration/aliases/remote-database-alias-configuration.adoc#remote-alias-config-DBMS_admin-A[Configuration of DBMS with remote database alias].
If this configuration is not performed, the `seedCredential` option fails.

For example, in the case of `S3SeedProvider`(the default provider), `seedCredentials: [accessKey];[secretKey]` where `accessKey` and `secretKey` are provided by AWS.

[[cluster-allow-deny-db]]
== Controlling locations with allowed/denied databases

A database can by default be allocated to run on any server in a cluster.
However, it is possible to constrain the servers that specific databases are hosted on.
This is done with `ENABLE SERVER` and `ALTER SERVER`, described in xref:clustering/servers.adoc[Managing servers in a cluster].
The following options are available:

** `allowedDatabases` - a set of databases that are allowed to be hosted on a server.
** `deniedDatabases` - a set of databases that are denied to be hosted on a server.
Allowed and denied are mutually exclusive.
** `modeConstraint` - controls in what mode (primary, secondary, or none) databases can be hosted on a server.
If not set, there are no mode constraints on the server.

[[cluster-default-database]]
== Change the default database

You can use the procedure xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_setDefaultDatabase[`dbms.setDefaultDatabase("newDefaultDatabaseName")`] to change the default database for a DBMS.

. Ensure that the database to be set as default exists, otherwise create it using the command `CREATE DATABASE <database-name>`.
. Show the name and status of the current default database by using the command `SHOW DEFAULT DATABASE`.
. Stop the current default database using the command `STOP DATABASE <database-name>`.
. Run `CALL dbms.setDefaultDatabase("newDefaultDatabaseName")` against the `system` database to set the new default database.
. Optionally, you can start the previous default database as non-default by using `START DATABASE <database-name>`.

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that the automatically created _initial_ default database may have a different topology to the default configuration values.
See xref:clustering/clustering-advanced/default-database.adoc[Default database in a cluster] for more information.
====

[[cluster-database-error-handling]]
== Handling errors

Databases can get into error states.
Typically you can observe this with the `SHOW DATABASES` command, and use the xref:database-administration/standard-databases/errors.adoc[error handling guidance] to help.

In more serious cases you may be dealing with a disaster situation, where the whole DBMS may not be responding correctly, or some specific databases cannot be restored without downtime.
Refer to the xref:clustering/disaster-recovery.adoc[disaster recovery guide] for those situations.
