[[show-databases-monitoring]]
= Monitor databases

In addition to the system-wide metrics and logs described in previous sections, to monitor the state of individual databases hosted in a cluster, use the `SHOW DATABASES` command.


[[show-databases-monitoring-listing]]
== Listing Databases

*Syntax:*

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES
----

*Returns:*

[options="header", cols="m,a,a"]
|===
| Name            | Type         | Description
| name            | String       | The human-readable name of the database.
| type            | String       | `standard`, `system` or `composite`.
| aliases         | List<String> | The names of any aliases the database may have.
| access          | String       | The database access mode, either `read-write` or `read-only`.
| address         | String       | The bolt address of the server hosting the database.
| role            | String       | The cluster role which the server fulfills for this database.
| writer          | Boolean      | `true` for the database node that accepts writes.
This node is either the leader for this database in a cluster _or_ this is a standalone server.
| requestedStatus | String       | The state that an operator has requested the database to be in.
| currentStatus   | String       | The state the database is actually in on this server.
| statusMessage   | String       | A message explaining the current state of the database, which could be an error encountered by the Neo4j server when transitioning the database to `requestedStatus`, if any.
| default         | Boolean      | Whether this database is the default for this DBMS.
| home            | Boolean      | Whether this database is the home database for this user.
| constituents    | List<String> | A list of alias names making up this Composite database, null for non-Composite databases.
|===

Note that for failed databases, `currentStatus` and `requestedStatus` are different.
This can imply an error.
For example:

* A database may take a while to transition from "offline" to "online", due to performing recovery.
* During normal operation, the `currentStatus` of a database may be transiently different from its `requestedStatus`, due to a necessary automatic process, such as one server copying store files from another.

The possible statuses are `initial`, `offline`, `store copying`, `deallocating`, `unknown`, `dirty`, and `quarantined`.

Additionally, note that databases hosted on servers that are offline are also returned by the `SHOW DATABASES` command.
For such databases the `address` column displays `NULL`, the `currentStatus` column displays `unknown`, and the `statusMessage` displays `Server is unavailable`.

.Listing databases in standalone Neo4j
====
When executing `SHOW DATABASES` against a standalone server, the following output is expected:

[source,queryresults,role=noplay]
----
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name    | type      | aliases | access     | address        | role      | writer | requestedStatus | currentStatus | statusMessage | default | home | constituents |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|"neo4j"  |"standard" |[]       |"read-write"|"localhost:7687"| "primary" | true   | "online"        | "online"      | ""            |true     |true  |[]            |
|"system" |"system"   |[]       |"read-write"|"localhost:7687"| "primary" | true   | "online"        | "online"      | ""            |false    |false |[]            |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----

Note that the `role`, `writer`, and `address` columns are primarily intended to distinguish between the states of a given database, across multiple servers deployed in a xref:clustering/introduction.adoc[cluster].
In a standalone deployment with a single server, the `address` field should be the same for every database, the `role` field should always be "primary", and the `writer` field should be true.

.Listing databases in a cluster

When running `SHOW DATABASES` against a cluster, expect similar output to the following:

[source,queryresults,role=noplay]

|"system" |"system"   |[]       |"read-write"|"localhost:7683"|"primary"  |false   |"online"         |"online"       |""             |false    |false |[]            |
|"system" |"system"   |[]       |"read-write"|"localhost:7684"|"secondary"|false   |"online"         |"online"       |""             |false    |false |[]            |
|"foo"    |"standard" |[]       |"read-write"|"localhost:7681"|"primary"  |true    |"online"         |"online"       |""             |false    |false |[]            |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----
Note that `SHOW DATABASES` does **not** return 1 row per database.
Instead, it returns 1 row per database, per server that hosts it in the cluster.
Therefore, if the cluster has four servers hosting 3 databases each with 3 primaries and one secondary, 12 rows are displayed.
In addition this means that if all the servers that host a database are offline, the database will not appear in the results of `SHOW DATABASES`.

The possible roles are "primary", "secondary", and "unknown".

Note that different servers may have different roles for each database, and a server may have different roles for different databases.

If a database is offline on a particular server, either because it was stopped by an operator, or an error has occurred, its cluster `role` is "unknown".
