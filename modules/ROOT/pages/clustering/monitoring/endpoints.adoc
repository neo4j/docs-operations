= Monitor cluster endpoints for status information

A cluster exposes some HTTP endpoints which can be used to monitor the health of the cluster.
This section describes these endpoints and explains their semantics.


[[clustering-http-endpoints-adjusting-security-for-cc]]
== Adjusting security settings for clustering endpoints

If authentication and authorization is enabled in Neo4j, the clustering status endpoints also require authentication credentials.
The setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_enabled[`dbms.security.auth_enabled`] controls whether the native auth provider is enabled.
For some load balancers and proxy servers, providing authentication credentials with the request is not an option.
For those situations, consider disabling authentication of the clustering status endpoints by setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.cluster_status_auth_enabled[`dbms.security.cluster_status_auth_enabled=false`] in xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[_neo4j.conf_].


[[clustering-http-endpoints-unified]]
== Unified endpoints

A unified set of endpoints exist, both on primary and secondary servers, with the following behavior:

* `/db/<databasename>/cluster/writable` -- Used to direct `write` traffic to specific instances.
* `/db/<databasename>/cluster/read-only` -- Used to direct `read` traffic to specific instances.
* `/db/<databasename>/cluster/available` -- Available for the general case of directing arbitrary request types to instances that are available for processing read transactions.
* `/db/<databasename>/cluster/status` -- Gives a detailed description of this instance's view of its status within the cluster, for the given database.
* `/dbms/cluster/status` -- Gives a detailed description of this instance's view of its status within the cluster, for all databases.
Useful for monitoring and coordinating rolling upgrades.
See <<clustering-http-endpoints-status, Status endpoints>> for further details.

Every `/db/<databasename>/*` endpoint targets a specific database.
The `databaseName` path parameter represents the name of the database.
By default, a fresh Neo4j installation with two databases `system` and `neo4j` has the following cluster endpoints:

[source]
--------------
http://localhost:7474/dbms/cluster/status

http://localhost:7474/db/system/cluster/writable
http://localhost:7474/db/system/cluster/read-only
http://localhost:7474/db/system/cluster/available
http://localhost:7474/db/system/cluster/status

http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/cluster/writable
http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/cluster/read-only

http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/cluster/status
--------------

[NOTE]
====
Attempting to access endpoints for a database not hosted on a server produces a `404` response.

.Use a clustering monitoring endpoint
====
From the command line, a common way to ask those endpoints is to use `curl`.
With no arguments, `curl` does an HTTP `GET` on the URI provided and outputs the body text, if any.
If the response code is desired, just add the `-v` flag for verbose output.
Here are some examples:

* Requesting `writable` endpoint on a primary server that is currently elected leader with verbose output:

[source, curl]
--------------
#> curl -v localhost:7474/db/neo4j/cluster/writable
* About to connect() to localhost port 7474 (#0)
*   Trying ::1...

[[clustering-http-endpoints-status]]
=== Status endpoints

The  status endpoint, available at `/db/<databasename>/cluster/status`, is to be used to assist with rolling upgrades.
For more information, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/upgrade-migration-guide/current/version-5/upgrade-minor/#_clusters[Upgrade and Migration Guide -> Clusters].

Typically, it is desired to have some guarantee that a primary is safe to shutdown for each database before removing it from a cluster.
Counter-intuitively, that a primary is safe to shutdown means that a majority of the *other* primaries are healthy, caught up, and have recently heard from that database's leader.
The status endpoints provide the following information in order to help resolve such issues.

[NOTE]
====
Several of the fields in status endpoint responses refer to details of Raft, the algorithm used in Neo4j clusters to provide highly available transactions.
In a Neo4j cluster each database has its own independent Raft group.
Therefore, details such as `leader` and `raftCommandsPerSecond` are database-specific.

| `votingMembers`                | string[] | no     | `[]`                                   | A member is considered a voting member when the leader has been receiving communication with it.

[CAUTION]
====
The `isHealthy` status applies only to this member's local database.
It does not reflect the overall health of the database if it is clustered.

A cluster member may still report `"isHealthy": true` even if the database currently has no leader and so cannot accept write transactions.

`raftCommandsPerSecond` is not an effective way to monitor that servers are not falling behind in updated and is hence deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of Neo4j.
It is recommended to use the metric `<prefix>.clustering.core.commit_index` on each server and look for divergence instead.
|===

After an instance has been switched on, the status endpoint can be accessed in order to make sure all the guarantees listed in the table below are met.



To get the most accurate view of a cluster it is strongly recommended to access the _status endpoint_ on all primary members and compare the result.
The following table explains how results can be compared.

                                             Membership is determined by using the `memberId` and `votingMembers` from the status endpoint.                                                                   | Sometimes network conditions are not perfect and it may make sense to switch off a different primary than the one originally was to be switched off.

| `noMembersLagging`                         | For primary A with `lastAppliedRaftIndex` = `min`, and primary B with `lastAppliedRaftIndex` = `max`, `B.lastAppliedRaftIndex-A.lastAppliedRaftIndex<raftIndexLagThreshold`. | If there is a large difference in the applied indexes between primaries, then it could be dangerous to switch off a primary.
|===

[NOTE]
====
`raftIndexLagThreshold` helps you to monitor the lag in applying Raft log entries across a cluster and set appropriate thresholds.
You should pick a `raftIndexLagThreshold` appropriate to your particular cluster and workload.
Measuring the reported lag under normal circumstances and selecting a threshold slightly above that would be a good way to select an appropriate value.
For example, you observe the metric (the difference between the maximum and minimum `lastAppliedRaftIndex`) during all phases of the specific workload and see that it spends all of the working hours around 100 or less, but on Saturdays it spikes to 5,000 for a few hours.
Then, depending on your monitoring needs or capabilities, you either set a weekday threshold of 120 and a weekend threshold of 6,000 or just an overall threshold of 6,000.
These thresholds can help in identifying performance issues.

[[combined-status-endpoints]]
=== Combined status endpoints

When using the status endpoints to support a rolling upgrade, it is required to assess whether a primary is safe to shut down for *all* databases.
To avoid having to issue a separate request to each `/db/<databasename>/cluster/status` endpoint, use the `/dbms/cluster/status` instead.

This endpoint returns a json array, the elements of which contain the same fields as the <<clustering-http-endpoints-status-example, single database version>>, along with fields for for `databaseName` and `databaseUuid`.
