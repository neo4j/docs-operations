:description: This section covers the use of `SHOW SERVERS` Cypher commands.
[role=enterprise-edition]
[[show-servers-monitoring]]
= Monitor servers

To monitor the state of individual servers in a cluster, use the `SHOW SERVERS` command.


[[show-servers-monitoring-listing]]
== Listing Servers

*Syntax:*

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW SERVERS
----

*Returns:*

[options="header", cols="m,a,a"]
|===
| Name            | Type         | Description
| name            | String       | The friendly name of the server, or its UUID if no name is set.
| address         | String       | The address of the Bolt port for the server. May be `null`.
| state           | String       | The state of the server in the topology.
| health          | String       | The current availability of the server.
| hosting         | List<String> | Databases that this server is currently running.
|===

=== Possible values of `state`
* `Free` - server has been started, but not added to the cluster. It needs to be added with `ENABLE SERVER`.
* `Enabled` - server is part of cluster and can have database allocated to it.
* `Cordoned` - server may be hosting databases, but cannot have any more allocated to it.
* `Deallocating` - server is in the process of removing its databases.
This may take some time, because it does not stop its copy of a database, if in primary mode, until another server has fully started its copy, to preserve the requested number of primaries.
* `Deallocated` - server has completed removing its databases.
* `Dropped` - server has been removed from the cluster, but the process has not exited.

=== Possible values of `health`
* `Available` - server has recently been in contact with the cluster member executing `SHOW SERVERS`.
* `Unavailable` - server has not had successful network communication with the cluster for a while.

[NOTE]
====
`Unavailable` does not necessarily mean the server is not running, just that there are network problems connecting to it.

When running `SHOW SERVERS` against a cluster, expect similar output to the following:

[[show-servers-monitoring-listing-extended]]
=== Listing more details of servers

If more details about the servers are needed, `SHOW SERVERS` can be appended with `YIELD *`.

*Syntax:*

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW SERVERS YIELD *
----

*Returns:*

[options="header", cols="m,a,a"]
|===
| Name             | Type         | Description
| serverId         | String       | The UUID of the server
| name             | String       | The friendly name of the server, or its UUID if no name is set.
| address          | String       | The address of the Bolt port for the server.
May be `null`.
| httpAddress      | String       | The address of the HTTP port for the server.
May be `null`.
| httpsAddress     | String       | The address of the HTTPS port for the server. May be `null`.
| state            | String       | The state of the server in the topology.
| health           | String       | The current availability of the server.
| hosting          | List<String> | Databases that this server is currently running.
| requestedHosting | List<String> | Databases that this server is supposed to be running.
May be fewer databases if the server is in the process of safely stopping one, or more databases if the server is in the process of starting one up.
Composite databases do not currently appear in this list, though they do appear in `hosting` for all servers.
| tags             | List<String> | Tags applied to this server.
Used for routing policies.
| allowedDatabases | List<String> | A list of the only databases that are allowed on this server.
Empty means all are allowed.
| deniedDatabases  | List<String> | A list of databases that may not be hosted on this server.
Empty means all are allowed.
| modeConstraint   | String       | A limit on what modes (i.e. `primary` or `secondary`) a database can be in on this server.
| version          | String       | The version of Neo4j this server is running.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Only one of `allowedDatabases` and `deniedDatabases` can be set as they are mutually exclusive.
====

=== Possible values of `modeConstraint`
* `NONE` - any modes can be allocated to this server.
* `PRIMARY` - only primary modes can be allocated to this server. These may be the target of writes for the database.
* `SECONDARY` - only secondary modes can be allocated to this server. These will never write to the database, only read.
