:description: This chapter describes the configurations and operations of the different Neo4j cluster topologies. 

This chapter describes the following:

* xref:clustering/introduction.adoc[Introduction] -- An overview of the different Neo4j cluster topologies available.
* xref:clustering/deploy.adoc[Deploy a cluster] -- The basics of configuring and deploying a new cluster.
* xref:clustering/seed.adoc[Seed a cluster] -- How to deploy a cluster with pre-existing data.
* xref:clustering/discovery.adoc[Discovery] -- How members of a cluster discover each other.
* xref:clustering/intra-cluster-encryption.adoc[Intra-cluster encryption] -- How to secure the cluster communication.
* xref:clustering/internals.adoc[Internals] -- A few internals regarding the operation of the cluster.
* xref:clustering/settings.adoc[Settings reference] -- A summary of the most important cluster settings.
