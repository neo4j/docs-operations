| Term
| Description

| Allocator
| A component in the cluster that allocates databases to servers according to the topology constraints specified and an allocation strategy.

| Asynchronous replication
| Enables efficient scale-out of secondary database copies but offers no guarantees under fault conditions.
The data present in the secondary copy is not guaranteed to be consistent across the servers and may be behind the primary-hosted databases.

| Bookmark
| A marker the client can request from the cluster to ensure that it is able to read its own writes so that the application's state is consistent and only databases that have a copy of the bookmark are permitted to respond.

| Causal consistency
| Writes are replicated in the same order across all copies of the database within the cluster.

| Cluster
| A collection of servers running Neo4j that are configured to communicate with each other.
These may be used to host databases and the databases may be configured to replicate across servers in the cluster thus achieving read scalability or high availability.
A minimum of three servers is required for the cluster to be fault-tolerant.

| Database
| The data store for the nodes, relationships, and properties that make up the graph.
Multiple databases can be hosted on a Database Management Server (DBMS).

| Database Management Server (DBMS)
| The Neo4j services and system database running on an instance of a single server or cluster to provide one or more databases.

| Deallocate
| An act of safely removing (i.e. without loss of data or reduced fault tolerance) a database from a server, or removing a server from a cluster.

| Disaster recovery
| A manual intervention to restore availability of a cluster, or databases within a cluster.

| Election
| In the event that a leader becomes unresponsive, followers automatically trigger an election and vote for a new leader.
A majority is required for the vote to be successful.

| Fault tolerance
| A guarantee that committed transactions are available on the majority of primary databases.
In the event of failure, the cluster remains fault-tolerant as long as each database is hosted in primary mode on at least three servers.
Should the database suffer enough primary failures to lose fault tolerance, it can no longer process write transactions and becomes read-only. 

| Follower
| A primary copy of a database acting as a follower, receives and acknowledges synchronous writes from the leader.

| Leader
| A single primary copy of a database is designated as the leader. 
It receives all write transactions from clients and replicates writes synchronously to followers and asynchronously to secondary copies of the database.
Each database can have a different leader within the cluster.

| Primary
| A copy of the database that is able to process write transactions and is eligible to be elected as a leader.
It participates in fault tolerant writes as it is part of the majority required to acknowledge and commit write transactions.

| Read scaling
| Adding secondary copies of the database to the cluster can offload read queries from the primary databases and thus reduce the load and aid write performance of the cluster.

| Secondary
| An asynchronously replicated copy of the database that provides read scaling within the cluster.
It is also suitable for running graph analytic workloads in a cluster using Graph Data Science and taking backups without incurring load on the primary.

| Seed
| A file used to create a copy of a database on a single instance or on a member of a cluster.
This can be a database dump or a database backup.
_Seed_ can also be used as a verb to describe the act seeding a cluster from a backup.

| Server
| A physical machine, a virtual machine, or a container running Neo4j DBMS.
The server can be standalone or part of a cluster.

| Session consistency
| If a client issues a bookmark in the transaction, the client can be guaranteed to read at least its own writes in the cluster, regardless of which database it is communicating with.

| Standalone server
| A single server, or container, running Neo4j DBMS and not part of a cluster.

| Synchronous replication
| Ensures data durability and consistency within the cluster by requiring a majority of followers to acknowledge the transaction before the leader can continue processing.

| Topology
| A configuration that describes how the copies of a database should be spread across the servers in a cluster.
