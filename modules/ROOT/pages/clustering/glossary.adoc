| Term
| Description

| Allocator
| A component in the cluster that allocates databases to servers according to the topology constraints specified and an allocation strategy.

| Asynchronous replication
| Enables efficient scale out of secondary database copies but offers no guarantees under fault conditions.
The data present in the secondary copy is not guaranteed to be consistent across the servers and may be behind the primary-hosted databases.

| Bookmark
| A marker the client can request from the cluster to ensure that it is able to read its own writes so that the application's state is consistent and only databases that have a copy of the bookmark are permitted to respond.

| Causal consistency
| Writes are replicated in the same order across all copies of the database within the cluster.

| Cluster
| A collection of servers running Neo4j that are configured to communicate with each other.
These may be used to host databases and the databases may be configured to replicate across servers in the cluster thus achieving read scalability or high availability.
A minimunm of three servers are required for the cluster to be fault-tolerant.

| Database
| The data store for the nodes, relationships, and properties that make up the graph.
Multiple databases can be hosted on a Database Management Server (DBMS).

| Database Management Server (DBMS)
| The Neo4j services and system database running on an instance of a single server or cluster to provide one or more databases.

| Deallocate
| An act fo safely (i.e. without loss of data or reduced fault tolerance) removing a database from a server, or removing a server from a cluster.

| Disaster recovery
| A manual intervention to restore availability of a cluster, or databases within a cluster.

| Election
| In the event that a Leader becomes unresponsive, Followers automatically trigger an election and vote for a new Leader.
Majority is required for the vote to be successful.

| Fault tolerance
| A guarantee that committed transactions are available on the majority of primary databases.
In the event of failure, the cluster remains fault-tolerant as long as each database is hosted in primary mode on at least three servers.
Should the database suffer enough primary failures to lose fault tolerance, it can no longer process write transactions and becomes read-only.
