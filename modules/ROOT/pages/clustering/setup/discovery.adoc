= Cluster server discovery

In order to join a running cluster, any new member must know the addresses of at least some of the other servers in the cluster.
This information is necessary to connect to the servers, run the discovery protocol, and obtain all the information about the cluster.

Neo4j provides several mechanisms for cluster members to discover each other and form a cluster based on the configuration and the environment in which the cluster is running, as well as the version of Neo4j being used.

[IMPORTANT]
====
From Neo4j 5.23, a new version v2 has been introduced.
The new version v2 is recommended for new deployments.
The current version v1 has been deprecated.
However, existing deployments can continue to use the current version v1 in all Neo4j 5.x versions.
====

The new version v2 introduces the following configuration settings to control the discovery service:

* xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints[`dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints`] to specify the list of server addresses for discovery when using version v2.
* xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.cluster.discovery.version[`dbms.cluster.discovery.version`] to specify the version of the discovery service.
Possible values are `V1_ONLY`, `V2_ONLY`, `V2_OVER_V1`, and `V2_OVER_V1`.
* xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name[`dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name`] to specify the name of the service port name used in the Kubernetes API when using version v2.

The following sections describe the different methods for server discovery, configuration settings, and examples of how to move from discovery service v1 to v2.

[[clustering-discovery-methods]]
== Methods for server discovery

Depending on the type of xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type[`dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type`] currently in use, the discovery service can use a list of server addresses, DNS records, or Kubernetes services to discover other servers in the cluster.
The discovery configuration is used for initial discovery and to continuously exchange information about changes to the topology of the cluster.

[[clustering-discovery-list]]
=== Discovery using a list of server addresses

If the addresses of the other cluster members are known upfront, they can be listed explicitly.
However, this method has limitations, such as:

* If servers are replaced and the new members have different addresses, the list becomes outdated.
An outdated list can be avoided by ensuring that the new members can be reached via the same address as the old members, but this is not always practical.
* Under some circumstances the addresses are unknown when configuring the cluster.
This can be the case, for example, when using container orchestration to deploy a cluster.

To use this method, set `dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=LIST` and hard code the addresses in the configuration of each server.
For example:

[.tabbed-example]
=====
[role=include-with-discovery-service-v1 label--deprecated-5.23]
======
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=LIST

server.discovery.advertised_address=server01.example.com:5000
dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints=server01.example.com:5000,server02.example.com:5000,server03.example.com:5000

dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V1_ONLY
----
======
[role=include-with-discovery-service-v2 label--new-5.23]
======
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=LIST

server.cluster.advertised_address=server01.example.com:6000
dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints=server01.example.com:6000,server02.example.com:6000,server03.example.com:6000

dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_ONLY
----
======
=====

An example of using this method with discovery service v1 is illustrated by xref:clustering/setup/deploy.adoc#cluster-example-configure-a-three-primary-cluster[Configure a cluster with three servers].

[[clustering-discovery-dns]]
=== Discovery using DNS with multiple records

Where it is not practical or possible to explicitly list the addresses of cluster members to discover, you can use DNS-based mechanisms.
In such cases, a DNS record lookup is performed when a server starts up based on configuration settings.
Once a server has joined a cluster, further topology changes are communicated amongst the servers in the cluster as part of the discovery service.

The following DNS-based mechanisms can be used to get the addresses of other servers in the cluster for discovery:


`dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=DNS`::
With this configuration, the initial discovery members are resolved from _DNS A_ records to find the IP addresses to contact.
In version 1, the value of `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` should be set to a single domain name and the port of the discovery service, while in version 2, the value of `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` should be set to a single domain name and the cluster advertised port.
For example:
+
[.tabbed-example]
=====
[role=include-with-discovery-service-v1 label--deprecated-5.23]
======
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=DNS

server.discovery.advertised_address=server01.example.com:5000
dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints=cluster01.example.com:5000

dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V1_ONLY
----
======
[role=include-with-discovery-service-v2 label--new-5.23]
======
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=DNS

server.cluster.advertised_address=server01.example.com:6000
dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints=cluster01.example.com:6000

dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_ONLY

----
======
=====
+
When a DNS lookup is performed, the domain name returns an A record for every server in the cluster, where each A record contains the IP address of the server.
The configured server uses all the IP addresses from the A records to join or form a cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The discovery port must be the same on all servers when using this configuration.
If this is not possible, consider using the discovery type `SRV`.
====

`dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=SRV`::
With this configuration, the initial discovery members are resolved from _DNS SRV_ records to find the IP addresses/hostnames and discovery service ports (v1) *or* cluster advertised ports (v2) to contact.
+
The value of `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` must be set to a single domain name and the port set to `0`.
The domain name returns a single SRV record when a DNS lookup is performed.
For example:
+
[.tabbed-example]
=====
[role=include-with-discovery-service-v1 label--deprecated-5.23]
======
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=SRV

server.discovery.advertised_address=server01.example.com:5000
dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints=cluster01.example.com:0

dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V1_ONLY
----
The SRV record returned by DNS should contain the IP address or hostname, and the *discovery* port for the servers to be discovered.
The configured server uses all the addresses from the SRV record to join or form a cluster.
======
[role=include-with-discovery-service-v2 label--new-5.23]
======
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=SRV

server.cluster.advertised_address=server01.example.com:6000
dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints=cluster01.example.com:0

dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_ONLY
----

The SRV record returned by DNS should contain the IP address or hostname, and the **cluster** port for the servers to be discovered.
The configured server uses all the addresses from the SRV record to join or form a cluster.
======
=====

[[clustering-discovery-k8s]]
=== Discovery in Kubernetes
A special case is when a cluster is running in https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes^] and each server is running as a Kubernetes service.
Then, the addresses of the other servers can be obtained using the List Service API, as described in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/[Kubernetes API documentation^].

The following settings are used to configure for this scenario:

* Set `dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=K8S`.
* Set `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.kubernetes.label_selector[dbms.kubernetes.label_selector]` to the label selector for the cluster services.
For more information, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors[Kubernetes official documentation^].
* Depending on your discovery service version, set either `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.kubernetes.service_port_name[dbms.kubernetes.service_port_name]` (v1), or xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name[`dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name]` (v2) to the name of the service port used in the Kubernetes service definition for the Core's discovery port.
For more information, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#serviceport-v1-core[Kubernetes official documentation^].

With this configuration, `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` is not used and any value assigned to it is ignored.

[NOTE]
====
* The pod running Neo4j must use a service account that has permission to list services.
For further information, see the Kubernetes documentation on https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[RBAC authorization^] or https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/[ABAC authorization^].
* The configured `server.discovery.advertised_address` must exactly match the Kubernetes-internal DNS name, which is of the form `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.
====

The discovery configuration is used for initial discovery and to continuously exchange information about changes to the topology of the cluster.

[[clustering-discovery-v1-to-v2]]
== Moving from discovery service v1 to v2

From Neo4j 5.23, you can move from the current discovery service v1 to the new version v2.
The v1 and v2 discovery services are designed to be able to run in parallel.
They are completely independent of each other, thus allowing you to keep the cluster functioning while switching over from v1 to v2.

There are three ways to move from the current discovery service v1 to the new version v2 depending on the environment and the requirements of the cluster.

=== Preparation

The following examples assume that you have a running cluster with three servers and you want to move from the current discovery service v1 to the new version v2.

image:discovery-service/v1-only.png[]

Before moving from the current discovery service v1 to the new version v2, ensure that the new settings are added to the configuration depending on the type of xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type[`dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type`] in use:

* If `dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=LIST`, set `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` to a comma-separated list of xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.cluster.advertised_address[`server.cluster.advertised_address`].
It is important that both `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` and `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` are set during the operation.
For more information, see <<clustering-discovery-list>>.

* If `dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=DNS`, set `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` to a single domain name and the cluster port.
Alternatively, if `dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=SRV`, set `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` to a single domain name and the port set to `0`.
It is important that both `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` and `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` are set during the operation.
For more information, see <<clustering-discovery-dns>>.

* If `dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=K8S`, set `dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name` to the name of the service port used in the Kubernetes service definition for the cluster port.
It is important that both `dbms.kubernetes.service_port_name` and `dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name` are set during the operation.
For more information, see <<clustering-discovery-k8s>>.

[[discovery-v1-to-v2-in-place]]
=== In-place rolling

[IMPORTANT]
====
In-place rolling reduces fault tolerance temporarily because you are restarting a running server.
To keep fault-tolerance, you can introduce a fourth server temporarily.
====
. For all the servers, ensure that new settings are added to the configuration as detailed the xref:clustering/setup/discovery.adoc#_preparation[Preparation] section.
+
As an example, for those using the list resolver, the settings for all the servers should include:
+
[source, parameters]
----
dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=LIST

dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints=server01.example.com:5000,server02.example.com:5000,server03.example.com:5000
dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints=server01.example.com:6000,server02.example.com:6000,server03.example.com:6000
----
. Restart server01 with the new setting `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V1_OVER_V2`.
+
image:discovery-service/in-place-1-v1-over-v2.png[]
. Run `SHOW SERVERS` and ensure that all three members are alive.
. Then repeat steps 2 and 3 for server02 and server03.
Ensure that they are set to `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V1_OVER_V2`.
Restart them sequentially, not in parallel.
+
image:discovery-service/in-place-23-v1-over-v2.png[]

. Using `bolt://`, connect to the system database of servers 1, 2, 3, and run the following procedure.
This can be done using via `./cypher-shell -a bolt://localhost:7681 -d system` for example.
+
[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState();
----
+
They should display "Matching" in the `stateComparison` column.

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
----
+
If they are not, wait and try again.
+
. Restart server01 again with the new setting `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_OVER_V1`.
+
image:discovery-service/in-place-1-v2-over-v1.png[]
+
. Run `SHOW SERVERS` and ensure that all three members are alive.
. Then repeat steps 6 and 7 for servers 2 and 3.
Ensure that they are set to `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_OVER_V1`.
Restart them sequentially, not in parallel.
+
image:discovery-service/in-place-23-v2-over-v1.png[]

. Similar to step 5, verify that `stateComparison` shows `Matching`.

. Repeat steps 6, 7, 8, 9, restarting servers 1, 2, and 3 sequentially, with the new setting `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_ONLY`
image:discovery-service/in-place-123-v2-only.png[]
. Verify that `CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState()` now shows `V2_ONLY` running.
Note that `stateComparison` is `N/A` because you do not have v1 to compare states anymore.

[[discovery-v1-to-v2-new-server]]
=== New server rolling
The new server rolling requires three running servers and three new servers.

. Start up the three new servers with the setting `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V1_OVER_V2`.
+
image:discovery-service/v1_over_v2.png[]
+
The new servers should have settings which are updated as detailed in the xref:clustering/setup/discovery.adoc#_preparation[Preparation] section.
The discovery addresses should include addresses of the new members, and the previous members.
+
As an example, for those using the list resolver, the settings for the new servers should include:
+
[source, parameters]

. Using `bolt://`, connect to the system database of servers 4, 5, 6, and run the following procedure.
This can be done using via `./cypher-shell -a bolt://localhost:7685 -d system` for example.
+
[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState();
----

The expected result should display `v2ServerCount` as 3.
`stateComparison` is not expected to match at this stage because the original servers are not visible to the V2 discovery service.

[[discovery-v1-to-v2-procedures]]
=== Using procedures

// By using just procedures, the nice thing is that during the user's normal version upgrade, they can also add the new settings required for v2 discovery service.
// Then, when they are ready to migrate to v2, they can use the procedures and then finally, set the version to 'V2' in the neo4j.conf at the very end - which can just sit there till the next restart
// so no lighthouse-specific server restarts are required if all is done correctly.
//Note that the settings detailed above must first be set and the servers restarted to allow the settings to take effect.

. For all the servers, ensure that new settings are updated to the configuration as detailed the xref:clustering/setup/discovery.adoc#_preparation[Preparation] section.
+
As an example, for those using the list resolver, the settings for all the servers should include:
+
[source, parameters]

dbms.cluster.discovery.resolver_type=LIST

dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints=server01.example.com:5000,server02.example.com:5000,server03.example.com:5000
dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints=server01.example.com:6000,server02.example.com:6000,server03.example.com:6000
----
+
. In Cypher Shell, connect to the `system` database of server01 using `bolt://`.
It is important to connect via `bolt://` because otherwise the procedure might be routed and executed not on the intended server.
+
[source, shell, role=nocopy noplay]
----
./cypher-shell -a bolt://localhost:7681 -d system
----

. Run the procedure:
+
[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState();
----
+
The output indicates mode `V1_ONLY`, i.e., only v1 is running on this server.
+
.Expected result
[queryresult]
----
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| mode      | stateComparison | v1ServerCount | v2ServerCount |

----

. Run the following procedure to turn on v2 in the background, but keep v1 running in the foreground:
+
[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.switchDiscoveryServiceVersion("V1_OVER_V2");
----

. Check the state again:
+
[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState();
----
+
Now the returned mode for this server must be `V1_OVER_V2` and the `stateComparison` must show that the states are not matching yet.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
----
+
The score is a measure of how different the states are.
`serverCounts` displays how many servers can be found by v1 and v2 of the discovery service, respectively.
The score is 0 when the states are matching.
When some members are running just one of the discovery services (v1 or v2) and other members run both, the score stays permanently high.
This is no reason for worry.


. To fulfill this convergence, in different terminals, connect to server02 and server03 via `bolt://` and repeat steps 3 and 4 on both of them.

. Check the state on all servers again.
It should show that the states are `Matching`.
Both `serverCounts` should be 3.

. On all three servers, run:
+
[source,cypher]

At this point, v2 is the service that is running the cluster, with v1 running in the background.

----


. Finally, turn off v1 by running the following procedure on all three servers:
+
[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.cluster.switchDiscoveryServiceVersion("V2_ONLY");
----

.  Verify that `CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState();` now shows `V2_ONLY` running.
Note that `stateComparison` is `N/A` because you do not have v1 to compare states anymore.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
----
+
.Important
[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember to update the _neo4j.conf_ files for all the servers.
The switching using procedures does not persist anything to disk.
Therefore, when a server restarts, it starts right back with only v1 running.
As such, ensure that `dbms.cluster.discovery.version=V2_ONLY`, and that `dbms.cluster.discovery.v2.endpoints` or `dbms.kubernetes.discovery.v2.service_port_name`
are set as required, so that the servers start with v2 running on the next restart.
====



== Monitoring the progress and metrics

When moving from the current discovery service v1 to the new version v2, you can monitor the progress using the procedure `CALL dbms.cluster.showParallelDiscoveryState()`.
This procedure shows the current state of the discovery service on the server and the difference score between the states of the v1 and v2 discovery services.
The difference score is a measure of how different the states are.
The difference score reported by the procedure does not always stay at 0.
Here are some scenarios to consider:

* In the case of a cluster, when some members are running just one of the discovery services (v1 or v2) and other members run both, the score will stay permanently high.
This is no reason for worry.

* When changes happen in the cluster (like start/stop of a database/server or a leader switch) the difference score will temporarily be greater than 0.
It should reach 0 relatively fast again.

* If the difference score is greater than 0 for a longer period, the actual difference is printed in the _debug.log_.


You can also use the following metrics to monitor the discovery service:
