:description: How to seed a new Neo4j Causal Cluster with existing data. 

[[causal-clustering-seed-introduction]]
== Introduction

Regardless of whether you are just playing around with Neo4j or setting up a production environment, you likely have some existing data that you want to transfer into your xref:clustering/deploy.adoc[newly created Causal cluster].
Neo4j supports seeding a cluster from a database dump, a database backup, or from another data source (with the Import tool).
For more information about the different backup options and how to use the Neo4j Import tool, see xref:backup-restore/planning.adoc#backup-restore-options[Backup and restore options] and xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc[Neo4j Admin tool].

[NOTE]
====
The databases that you want to seed and the Neo4j cluster must be of the same version.
====

The process for seeding a cluster is essentially the same for clusters with Single and Read Replica instances as for clusters with Core (and optional Read Replica) instances.
However, using a designated seeder is only applicable to clusters with Core instances.
The seeding is usually performed on primary instances only but it is possible to seed a Read Replica instance, yet it is not necessary unless for performance reasons.

[[causal-clustering-seed-from-dump]]
== Seed a cluster from a database dump (offline)

If you have an existing Neo4j database that you want to use for your new cluster, use xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin dump`] to create an offline backup.
This could be an offline backup from a standalone Neo4j instance or a cluster member (e.g., an existing Read Replica instance).

[TIP]
====
This scenario is useful in disaster recovery where some servers have retained their data during a catastrophic event.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Moving files and directories manually in or out of a Neo4j installation is not recommended and considered unsupported.
====

. Create a new Neo4j Core-only cluster following the instructions in xref:clustering/deploy.adoc#clustering-new-core-instance-cluster[Configure a cluster with Core instances].
. Delete any databases with names conflicting with the ones in your seeds by using the Cypher command `DROP DATABASE <database-name` against the `system` database. +
The command is automatically routed to the appropriate Core instance and from there to the other cluster members.
+
[NOTE]
====
Dropping a database also deletes the users and roles associated with it.

If you cannot delete the database because Neo4j is not running or because your seeds include the `system` database (which cannot be dropped), you must run `neo4j-admin unbind` as described xref:tools/neo4j-admin/unbind.adoc[here].

. Run `neo4j-admin unbind` to turn the cluster members into standalone instances by removing their cluster state.
Otherwise, the store files you have (post restore) will be out of sync with the cluster state you have for that database, leading to logical corruption.
. Remove the store and transaction log files for the database in question.
The locations of these files may be xref:reference/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.directories.logs[configured].
====
+
. Stop each cluster member.
. Use xref:backup-restore/restore-dump.adoc[`neo4j-admin load`] to seed each of the Core members in the cluster.
+
The examples assume that you are restoring one user database with the default name of `neo4j` and the `system` database, containing the replicated configuration state.
Modify the command line arguments to match your exact setup.
+

neo4j-01$ ./bin/neo4j-admin load --from=/path/to/system.dump --database=system

== Seed a cluster from a database backup (online)

[TIP]
====
These scenarios are useful when you want to restore a database in a running cluster.
====

If you have a running Neo4j database that you want to seed in a running cluster, use xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin backup`] to create a database backup.
This could be a backup from a standalone Neo4j instance or another cluster member (e.g., an existing Read Replica).

Neo4j supports two types of seeding in a running cluster.
You can either transfer the database backup to each Core instance or transfer it only to one Core instance and then use the `CREATE DATABASE` Cypher command to seed the cluster.
For more information on the `CREATE DATABASE` syntax and options, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/databases#administration-databases-create-database[Cypher Manual -> Creating databases].

[CAUTION]
====
Moving files and directories manually in or out of a Neo4j installation is not recommended and considered unsupported.
====

[[clustering-seed-each-from-backups]]
=== Restore a database on each Core instance

Transfer the database backup to each Core instance in the cluster using the xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin restore`] command and then use `CREATE DATABASE` to restore it.
This example uses a user database called `movies1`.

. To ensure that the `movies1` database does not exist in the cluster, on one of the Core members, use xref:tools/cypher-shell.adoc[Cypher Shell] and run `DROP DATABASE movies1`.
Use the `system` database to connect.
The command is automatically routed to the appropriate Core instance and from there to the other cluster members.
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP DATABASE movies1;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Dropping a database also deletes the users and roles associated with it.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you cannot drop the database because your seeds include the `system` database (which cannot be dropped), you must run xref:tools/neo4j-admin/unbind.adoc[`neo4j-admin unbind`] .
However, this removes the cluster state of the Core instance and in turn the instance needs to be restarted in order to join the cluster.
Thus, you are no longer restoring a database in a running cluster.
See xref:clustering/seed.adoc#causal-clustering-seed-from-dump[Seed a cluster from a database dump (offline)] instead for instructions on how to seed an offline cluster.
====
. Restore the database on each Core member in the cluster.
+
[source, shell]
----
neo4j@core1$ ./bin/neo4j-admin restore --from=/path/to/movies1-backup-dir --database=movies1
neo4j@core2$ ./bin/neo4j-admin restore --from=/path/to/movies1-backup-dir --database=movies1
neo4j@core3$ ./bin/neo4j-admin restore --from=/path/to/movies1-backup-dir --database=movies1
----
+
However, restoring a database does not automatically create it.
. On one of the Core instances, run `CREATE DATABASE movies1` against the `system` database to create the `movies1` database.
The command is automatically routed to the appropriate Core instance and from there to the other cluster members.

[[causal-clustering-seed-all-from-backups]]
=== Restore a database using a designated seeder

With a seeder, you transfer the database backup to one Core instance in the cluster using the xref:backup-restore/restore-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin restore`] command.
Then you use that member as a designated seeder to create the backed-up database on the other cluster members.

This example uses a user database called `movies1` and a cluster that consists of three Core instances.
The `movies1` database *does not* exist on any of the cluster members.

If a database with the same name as your backup already exists in your cluster, see step 1 in xref:clustering/seed.adoc#clustering-seed-each-from-backups[Restore a database on each Core instance] for details on how to drop it.

. Restore the `movies1` database on one of the Core instances.
In this example, the `core1` member is used.
+
[source, shell]
----
neo4j@core1$ ./bin/neo4j-admin restore --from=/path/to/movies1-backup-dir --database=movies1
----
. Find the server ID of `core1` by logging in to Cypher Shell and running `dbms.cluster.overview()`.
Use any database to connect.

. On one of the Core instances, use the `system` database and create the database `movies1` using the server ID of `core1`.

== Seed a cluster using the import tool

To create a cluster based on imported data, it is recommended to first import the data into a standalone Neo4j DBMS and then use an offline backup to seed the cluster.

. Import the data.
.. Deploy a standalone Neo4j DBMS.
.. Import the data using the xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc[import tool].
. Use xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin dump`] to create an offline backup of the `neo4j` database.
. Seed a new cluster using the instructions in xref:clustering/seed.adoc#causal-clustering-seed-from-dump[Seed a cluster from a database dump (offline)].
+
Skip the `system` database in this scenario since it is not needed.
