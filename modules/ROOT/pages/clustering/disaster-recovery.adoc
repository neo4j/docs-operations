= Disaster recovery

Databases can become unavailable for different reasons.
For the purpose of this section, an _unavailable database_ is defined as a database that is incapable of serving writes, while still may be able to serve reads.
Databases not performing as expected for other reasons are not considered unavailable and cannot be helped by this section.
//Refer to <<link to error handling section, TBD>> for more information on troubleshooting.
This section contains a step-by-step guide on how to recover databases that have become unavailable.
By performing the actions described here, the unavailable databases are recovered and made fully operational with as little impact as possible on the other databases in the cluster.

There are many reasons why a database becomes unavailable and it can be caused by issues on different levels in the system.
For example, a data-center failover may lead to the loss of multiple serves which in turn may cause a set of databases to become unavailable.
It is also possible for databases to become quarantined due to a critical failure in the system which may lead to unavailability even without loss of servers.

[NOTE]
====
If *all* servers in a Neo4j cluster are lost in a data-center failover, it is not possible to recover the current cluster.
A new cluster has to be created and the databases restored.
See xref:clustering/setup/deploy.adoc[Deploy a basic cluster] and xref:clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed[Seed a database] for more information.

== Faults in clusters

Databases in clusters follow an allocation strategy.
This means that they are allocated differently within the cluster and may also have different numbers of primaries and secondaries.
The consequence of this is that all servers are different in which databases they are hosting.
Losing a server in a cluster may cause some databases to lose a member while others are unaffected.
Consequently, in a disaster where multiple servers go down, some databases may keep running with little to no impact, while others may lose all their allocated resources.

== Guide to disaster recovery

There are three main steps to recover a cluster from a disaster.
Depending on the disaster scenario, some steps may not be required, but it is recommended to complete each step in order to ensure that the cluster is fully operational.

The first step is to ensure that the `system` database is available in the cluster. 
The `system` database defines the configuration for the other databases and therefore it is vital to ensure that it is available before doing anything else.

Once the `system` database's availability is verified, whether it was recovered or unaffected by the disaster, the next step is to recover lost servers to make sure the cluster's topology requirements are met.

Only after the `system` database is available and the cluster topology is satisfied, can the databases be managed.

The steps are described in detail in the following sections.

[NOTE]
====
In this section, an _offline_ server is a server that is not running but may be _restartable_.
A _lost_ server however, is a server that is currently not running and cannot be restarted.
====

[NOTE]
====
Disasters may sometimes affect the routing capabilities of the driver and may prevent the use of the `neo4j` scheme for routing.
One way to remedy this is to connect directly to the server using `bolt` instead of `neo4j`.
See xref:clustering/setup/routing.adoc#clustering-routing[Server-side routing] for more information on the `bolt` scheme.
====

=== Restore the `system` database

The first step of recovery is to ensure that the `system` database is available.
The `system` database is required for clusters to function properly.

. Start all servers that are _offline_.
(If a server is unable to start, inspect the logs and contact support personnel.
The server may have to be considered indefinitely lost.)
. *Validate the `system` database's availability.*
.. Run `SHOW DATABASE system`.
If the response doesn't contain a writer, the `system` database is unavailable and needs to be recovered, continue to step 3.
.. Optionally, you can create a temporary user to validate the `system` database's writability by running `CREATE USER 'temporaryUser' SET PASSWORD 'temporaryPassword'`.
... Confirm that the query was executed successfully and the temporary user was created as expected, by running `SHOW USERS`, then continue to xref:clustering/disaster-recovery.adoc#recover-servers[Recover servers].
If not, continue to step 3.
+
. *Restore the `system` database.*
+
[NOTE]
====
Only do the steps below if the `system` database's availability could not be validated by the first two steps in this section.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Recall that the cluster remains fault tolerant, and thus able to serve both reads and writes, as long as a majority of the primaries are available.
In case of a disaster affecting one or more server(s), but where the majority of servers are still available, it is possible to add a new server to the cluster and recover the `system` database (and any other affected user databases) on it by copying the `system` database (and affected user databases) from one of the available servers.
This method prevents downtime for the other databases in the cluster.
If this is the case, ie. if a majority of servers are still available, follow the instructions in <<recover-servers>>.
====
+
The following steps creates a new `system` database from a backup of the current `system` database.
This is required since the current `system` database has lost too many members in the server failover.

.. Shut down the Neo4j process on all servers.
Note that this causes downtime for all databases in the cluster.
.. On each server, run the following `neo4j-admin` command `neo4j-admin dbms unbind-system-db` to reset the `system` database state on the servers.
See xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc#neo4j-admin-commands[`neo4j-admin` commands] for more information.
.. On each server, run the following `neo4j-admin` command `neo4j-admin database info system` to find out which server is most up-to-date, ie. has the highest last-committed transaction id.
.. On the most up-to-date server, take a dump of the current `system` database by running `neo4j-admin database dump system --to-path=[path-to-dump]` and store the dump in an accessible location.
See xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc#neo4j-admin-commands[`neo4j-admin` commands] for more information.
.. Ensure there are enough `system` database primaries to create the new `system` database with fault tolerance.
Either:
... Add completely new servers (see xref:clustering/servers.adoc#cluster-add-server[Add a server to the cluster]) or
... Change the `system` database mode (`server.cluster.system_database_mode`) on the current `system` database's secondary servers to allow them to be primaries for the new `system` database.
.. On each server, run `neo4j-admin database load system --from-path=[path-to-dump] --overwrite-destination=true` to load the current `system` database dump.
.. Ensure that `dbms.cluster.discovery.endpoints` are set correctly on all servers, see xref:clustering/setup/discovery.adoc[Cluster server discovery] for more information.
.. Return to step 1.


[[recover-servers]]
=== Recover servers

Once the `system` database is available, the cluster can be managed.
Following the loss of one or more servers, the cluster's view of servers must be updated, ie. the lost servers must be replaced by new servers.
The steps here identify the lost servers and safely detach them from the cluster.

. Run `SHOW SERVERS`.
If *all* servers show health `AVAILABLE` and status `ENABLED` continue to xref:clustering/disaster-recovery.adoc#recover-databases[Recover databases].
. On each `UNAVAILABLE` server, run `CALL dbms.cluster.cordonServer("unavailable-server-id")`.
. On each `CORDONED` server, run `DEALLOCATE DATABASES FROM SERVER cordoned-server-id`.
. On each server that failed to deallocate with one of the following messages:
.. `Could not deallocate server [server]. Can't move databases with only one primary [database].`
+
or
+
`Could not deallocate server(s) [server]. 
Database [database] has lost quorum of servers, only found [existing number of primaries] of [expected number of primaries]. 
Cannot be safely reallocated.`
+
First ensure that there is a backup for the database in question (see xref:backup-restore/online-backup.adoc[Online backup]), and then drop the database by running `DROP DATABASE database-name`.
Return to step 3.
.. `Could not deallocate server [server]. Cannot change allocations for database [stopped-db] because it is offline.`
+
Try to start the offline database by running `START DATABASE stopped-db WAIT`.
If it starts successfully, return to step 3.
Otherwise, ensure that there is a backup for the database before dropping it with `DROP DATABASE stopped-db`.
Return to step 3.
+
[NOTE]
====
A database can be set to `READ-ONLY`-mode before it is started to avoid updates on a database that is desired to be stopped with the following:
`ALTER DATABASE database-name SET ACCESS READ ONLY`.
====

.. `Could not deallocate server [server]. Reallocation of [database] not possible, no new target found. All existing servers: [existing-servers]. Actual allocated server with mode [mode] is [current-hostings].`
+
Add new servers and enable them and then return to step 3, see xref:clustering/servers.adoc#cluster-add-server[Add a server to the cluster] for more information.
. Run `SHOW SERVERS YIELD *` once all enabled servers host the requested databases (`hosting`-field contains exactly the databases in the `requestedHosting` field), proceed to the next step.
Note that this may take a few minutes.
. For each deallocated server, run `DROP SERVER deallocated-server-id`.
. Return to step 1.

[[recover-databases]]
=== Recover databases

Once the `system` database is verified available, and all servers are online, the databases can be managed.
The steps here aim to make the unavailable databases available.

. If you have previously dropped databases as part of this guide, re-create each one from backup.
See the xref:database-administration/standard-databases/manage-databases.adoc[Manage databases] section for more information on how to create a database.
. Run `SHOW DATABASES`.
If all databases are in desired states on all servers (`requestedStatus`=`currentStatus`), disaster recovery is complete.
// . For each database that remains unavailable, refer to <<unavailable-databases, Managing unavailable databases in a cluster>>.
// Perform the actions required to get the database available then return to step 2.
