:description: This chapter describes how to upgrade Neo4j from an earlier version. 

It is recommended that your installation of Neo4j is kept up to date.
Upgrading your installation to Neo4j {neo4j-version-exact} will ensure that you are provided with improvements in performance and security, as well as any latest bug fixes.

[NOTE]
====
There is no supported upgrade path from {neo4j-version} to 4.x.
Due to surface changes in Neo4j 4.x, you will need to perform a migration.
