= Set up a local Causal Cluster
:description: This tutorial walks through the basics of setting up a Neo4j Causal Cluster. The result is a local cluster of six instances: three Cores and three Read Replicas. 

[[tutorial-local-cluster-introduction]]
== Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a Causal Cluster locally on a single machine.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that a cluster on a single machine has no fault tolerance and is therefore not suitable for production use.
====

A typical Causal Cluster consists of three Core instances and three Read Replicas.
The Core instances are responsible for keeping the data safe, and the Read Replicas are responsible for scaling the capacity of the cluster.
For details on the number of servers required for a Causal Cluster, see xref:clustering/introduction.adoc#causal-clustering-core-servers[Core Servers].

The Core of the Causal Cluster is intended to remain stable over time.
The roles within the Core may change as needed, but the Core itself is long-lived and stable. +
Read Replicas live at the edge of the cluster and can be brought up and taken down without affecting the Core.
They can be added as needed to increase the operational capacity of the cluster as a whole.

For more information about Causal Clustering architecture, configuration, and operation, see xref:clustering/index.adoc[Clustering].

[[tutorial-local-cluster-download-neo4j]]
== Download Neo4j

You download Neo4j and prepare your local environment.

. Create a local working directory.
. Download a copy of the Neo4j Enterprise Edition from https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/#releases[the Neo4j download site].

[[tutorial-local-cluster-configure-cores]]
== Set up the Core servers
You create and configure three Core instances.

[discrete]
[[tutorial-local-cluster-configure-core01]]
=== Configure and start the first Core instance

You create and configure the first Core instance.

. Make a copy of the _neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}_ directory and name it _core-01_. +
You have to keep the original directory for setting up the other Core instances and Read Replicas.
The _core-01_ directory will contain the first Core instance.

[[tutorial-local-cluster-configure-core03]]
=== Create and configure the third Core instance

You create and configure the third Core instance.

. Make a new copy of the _neo4j-enterprise-{neo4j-version-exact}_ directory and name it _core-03_.

+
[source, shell]
----
core-03$ ./bin/neo4j start
----

[TIP]
.Startup Time
====
To follow along with the startup of a server, check the messages in _<instance-home>/logs/neo4j.log_:

* On a Unix system, run the command `tail -n100 logs/neo4j.log`.
* On Windows Server, run `Get-Content .\logs\neo4j.log -Tail 10 -Wait`.

While an instance is joining the cluster, the server may appear unavailable.
In the case where an instance is joining a cluster with lots of data, it may take a number of minutes for the new instance to download the data from the cluster and become available.

[[tutorial-local-cluster-check-status]]
== Check the status of the cluster

The minimal cluster of three Core servers is operational and is ready to serve requests.

Connect to any of the three Core instances to check the cluster status.

. Open _core-01_ at http://localhost:7474[http://localhost:7474^].
. Authenticate with the default `neo4j/neo4j` credentials, and set a new password when prompted.
. Check the status of the cluster by running the following in Neo4j Browser:

[[tutorial-local-cluster-configure-read-replicas]]
== Set up the Read Replicas

Because the Read Replicas do not participate in quorum decisions, their configuration is simpler than the configuration of the Core servers.

You configure a Read Replica by setting the address of a Core instance that it can bind to in order to discover the cluster.
For details, see xref:clustering-advanced/lifecycle.adoc#causal-clustering-discovery-protocol[Discovery protocol]. +
After the initial discovery, the Read Replicas can choose a Core instance from which to catch up.
For details, see xref:clustering-advanced/lifecycle.adoc#causal-clustering-catchup-protocol[Catchup protocol].
