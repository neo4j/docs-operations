:description: This tutorial provides detailed examples to illustrate the capabilities of importing data from CSV files with the command `neo4j-admin database import`.

This tutorial provides detailed examples to illustrate the capabilities of importing data from CSV files with the command xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc[`neo4j-admin database import`].
The import command is used for loading large amounts of data from CSV files and supports full and incremental import into a running or stopped Neo4j DBMS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `neo4j-admin database import` command does not create a database, the command only imports data and makes it available for the database.
The database must not exist before the `neo4j-admin database import` command has been executed, and the database should be created afterward.
The command will exit with an error message if the database already exists.
====

Relationships are created by connecting node IDs, each node should have a unique ID to be able to be referenced when creating relationships between nodes.
In the following examples, the node IDs are stored as properties on the nodes.
If you do not want the IDs to persist as properties after the import completes, then do not specify a property name in the `:ID` field.
//Investigate the :ID field vs. id(node) function

The examples show how to import data in a standalone Neo4j DBMS.
They use:

* The Neo4j tarball (xref:installation/linux/tarball.adoc#unix-console[Unix console application]).
* `$NEO4J_HOME` as the current working directory.
* The default database `neo4j`.
* The _import_ directory of the Neo4j installation to store all the CSV files.
However, the CSV files can be located in any directory of your file system.
* UNIX-styled paths.
* The xref:tools/neo4j-admin/index.adoc[`neo4j-admin database import`] command.

//To create a cluster based on imported data, see <<causal-clustering-seed-import>>.

[TIP]
.Handy tips:
====
* The details of a CSV file header format can be found at xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-header-format[CSV header format].
* To show available databases, use the Cypher query `SHOW DATABASES` against the `system` database.
* To remove a database, use the Cypher query `DROP DATABASE database_name` against the `system` database.
* To create a database, use the Cypher query `CREATE DATABASE database_name` against the `system` database.

== Import a small data set

In this example, you will import a small data set containing nodes and relationships.
The data set is split into three CSV files, where each file has a header row describing the data.

[discrete]
=== The data

The data set contains information about movies, actors, and roles.
Data for movies and actors are stored as nodes and the roles are stored as relationships.

The files you want to import data from are:

* `movies.csv`
* `actors.csv`
* `roles.csv`

Each movie in `movies.csv` has an `ID`, a `title`, and a `year`, stored as **properties** in the node.
All the nodes in `movies.csv` also have the **label** `Movie`.
A node can have several labels, as you can see in `movies.csv` there are nodes that also have the label `Sequel`.
The node labels are optional, they are very useful for grouping nodes into sets where all nodes that have a certain label belong to the same set.

.movies.csv
[source]
----
movieId:ID,title,year:int,:LABEL
tt0133093,"The Matrix",1999,Movie
tt0234215,"The Matrix Reloaded",2003,Movie;Sequel
tt0242653,"The Matrix Revolutions",2003,Movie;Sequel
----

The actors' data in `actors.csv` consist of an `ID` and a `name`, stored as **properties** in the node.
The ID in this case is a shorthand for the actor's name.
All the nodes in `actors.csv` have the label `Actor`.

.actors.csv
[source]
----
personId:ID,name,:LABEL
keanu,"Keanu Reeves",Actor
laurence,"Laurence Fishburne",Actor
carrieanne,"Carrie-Anne Moss",Actor
----

The roles data in `roles.csv` have only one **property**, `role`.
Roles are represented by relationship data that connects actor nodes with movie nodes.

There are three mandatory fields for relationship data:

. `:START_ID` -- ID referring to a node.
. `:END_ID` -- ID referring to a node.
. `:TYPE` -- The relationship type.

To create a relationship between two nodes, the IDs defined in `actors.csv` and `movies.csv` are used for the `:START_ID` and `:END_ID` fields.
You also need to provide a relationship type (in this case `ACTED_IN`) for the `:TYPE` field.

.roles.csv
[source]
----
:START_ID,role,:END_ID,:TYPE
keanu,"Neo",tt0133093,ACTED_IN
keanu,"Neo",tt0234215,ACTED_IN

----


[discrete]
=== Importing the data

* Paths to node data are defined with the `--nodes` option.
* Paths to relationship data is defined with the `--relationships` option.

The call to `neo4j-admin database import` would look like this:

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies.csv --nodes=import/actors.csv --relationships=import/roles.csv neo4j
----


[discrete]
=== Query the data

To query the data.
Start Neo4j.

[NOTE]
====
The default username and password are `neo4j` and `neo4j`.
====

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j start
----

To query the imported data in the graph, try a simple Cypher query.

.shell
[source]
----
bin/cypher-shell --database=neo4j "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as nodes"
----

Stop Neo4j.

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j stop
----


== CSV file delimiters

You can customize the configuration options that the import tool uses (see xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-options[Options]) if your data does not fit the default format.

The details of a CSV file header format can be found at xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-header-format[CSV header format].


[discrete]
=== The data

The following CSV files have:

* `--delimiter=";"`
* `--array-delimiter="U+007C"` (`U+007C` is the Unicode code point for the character `|`)
* `--quote="'"`

.movies2.csv

----


== Using separate header files

When dealing with very large CSV files, it is more convenient to have the header in a separate file.
This makes it easier to edit the header as you avoid having to open a huge data file just to change it.
The header file must be specified before the rest of the files in each file group.

The import tool can also process single-file compressed archives, for example:

* `--nodes=import/nodes.csv.gz`
* `--relationships=import/relationships.zip`


[discrete]
=== The data

You will use the same data set as in the previous example but with the headers in separate files.

.movies3-header.csv

----


[discrete]
=== Importing the data

The call to `neo4j-admin database import` would look as follows:

[NOTE]
====
The header line for a file group, whether it is the first line of a file in the group or a dedicated header file, must be the _first_ line in the file group.
====

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies3-header.csv,import/movies3.csv --nodes=import/actors3-header.csv,import/actors3.csv --relationships=import/roles3-header.csv,import/roles3.csv neo4j
----


== Multiple input files

In addition to using a separate header file, you can also provide multiple node or relationship files.
Files within such an input group can be specified with multiple match strings, delimited by `,`, where each matched string can be either the exact file name or a regular expression matching one or more files.
Multiple matching files will be sorted according to their characters and their natural number sort order for file names containing numbers.

[discrete]
=== Importing the data

The call to `neo4j-admin database import` would look like this:

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies4-header.csv,import/movies4-part1.csv,import/movies4-part2.csv --nodes=import/actors4-header.csv,import/actors4-part1.csv,import/actors4-part2.csv --relationships=import/roles4-header.csv,import/roles4-part1.csv,import/roles4-part2.csv neo4j
----


[discrete]
=== Regular expressions

File names can be specified using regular expressions when there are many data source files.
Each file name that matches the regular expression will be included.

If using separate header files, for the import to work correctly, the header file must be the first in the file group.
When using regular expressions to specify the input files, the list of files will be sorted according to the names of the files that match the expression.
The matching is aware of the numbers inside the file names and will sort them accordingly, without the need for padding with zeros.

.Match order
====
For example, let's assume that you have the following files:

* `movies4-header.csv`
* `movies4-data1.csv`
* `movies4-data2.csv`
* `movies4-data12.csv`

If you use the regular expression `+movies4.*+`, the sorting will place the header file last and the import will fail.
A better alternative would be to name the header file explicitly and use a regular expression that only matches the names of the data files.
For example: `+--nodes "import/movies4-header.csv,movies-data.*"+` will accomplish this.
====

Importing the data using regular expressions, the call to `neo4j-admin database import` can be simplified to:

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes="import/movies4-header.csv,import/movies4-part.*" --nodes="import/actors4-header.csv,import/actors4-part.*" --relationships="import/roles4-header.csv,import/roles4-part.*" neo4j
----

[NOTE]
====
The use of regular expressions should not be confused with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)[file globbing].

The expression `+.*+` means: "zero or more occurrences of any character except line break".
Therefore, the regular expression `+movies4.*+` will list all files starting with `movies4`.
Conversely, with file globbing, `+ls movies4.*+` will list all files starting with `movies4.`.

Another important difference to pay attention to is the sorting order.
The result of a regular expression matching will place the file `movies4-part2.csv` before the file `movies4-part12.csv`.
If doing `+ls movies4-part*+` in a directory containing the above-listed files, the file `movies4-part12.csv` will be listed before the file `movies4-part2.csv`.
====


== Using the same label for every node

If you want to use the same node label(s) for every node in your nodes file you can do this by specifying the appropriate value as an option to `neo4j-admin database import`.
There is then no need to specify the `:LABEL` column in the header file and each row (node) will apply the specified labels from the command line option.

.Specify node labels option
====
`--nodes=LabelOne:LabelTwo=import/example-header.csv,import/example-data1.csv`
====

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to apply both the label provided in the file and the one provided on the command line to the node.
====


[discrete]
=== The data

In this example, you want to have the label `Movie` on every node specified in `movies5a.csv`, and you put the labels `Movie` and `Sequel` on the nodes specified in `sequels5a.csv`.

----


== Using the same relationship type for every relationship

If you want to use the same relationship type for every relationship in your relationships file this can be done by specifying the appropriate value as an option to `neo4j-admin database import`.


.Specify relationship type option
====
`--relationships=TYPE=import/example-header.csv,import/example-data1.csv`
====

[NOTE]
====
If you provide a relationship type both on the command line and in the relationships file, the one in the file will be applied.
====

[discrete]
=== The data

In this example, you want the relationship type `ACTED_IN` to be applied on every relationship specified in `roles5b.csv`.

----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies5b.csv --nodes=import/actors5b.csv --relationships=ACTED_IN=import/roles5b.csv neo4j
----


== Properties

Nodes and relationships can have properties.
The property type is specified in the CSV header row, see xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-header-format[CSV header format].


[discrete]
=== The data

The following example creates a small graph containing one actor and one movie connected by one relationship.

There is a `roles` property on the relationship which contains an array of the characters played by the actor in a movie:

----
:START_ID,roles:string[],:END_ID,:TYPE
meg,"DeDe;Angelica Graynamore;Patricia Graynamore",tt0099892,ACTED_IN
----


[discrete]
=== Importing the data

The call to `neo4j-admin database import` would look like this:

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies6.csv --nodes=import/actors6.csv --relationships=import/roles6.csv neo4j
----


== ID space

The import tool assumes that identifiers are unique across node files.
This may not be the case for data sets that use sequential, auto-incremented, or otherwise colliding identifiers.
Those data sets can define ID spaces where identifiers are unique within their respective ID space.

In cases where the node ID is unique only within files, using ID spaces is a way to ensure uniqueness across all node files.
See xref:tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import.adoc#import-tool-id-spaces[Using ID spaces].

Each node processed by `neo4j-admin database import` must provide an ID if it is to be connected in any relationships.
The node ID is used to find the start node and end node when creating a relationship.

[NOTE]
====
From Neo4j 5.3, a node header can also contain multiple `ID` columns, where the relationship data references the composite value of all those columns.
This also implies using `string` as `id-type`.
For each `ID` column, you can specify to store its values as different node properties.
However, the composite value cannot be stored as a node property.
====

.ID space
====
To define an ID space `Movie-ID` for `movieId:ID`, use the syntax `movieId:ID(Movie-ID)`.
====


[discrete]
=== The data

For example, if movies and people both use sequential identifiers, then you would define `Movie` and `Actor` ID spaces.

.movies7.csv
[source]
----
movieId:ID(Movie-ID),title,year:int,:LABEL
1,"The Matrix",1999,Movie
2,"The Matrix Reloaded",2003,Movie;Sequel
3,"The Matrix Revolutions",2003,Movie;Sequel
----

.actors7.csv
[source]
----
personId:ID(Actor-ID),name,:LABEL
1,"Keanu Reeves",Actor
2,"Laurence Fishburne",Actor
3,"Carrie-Anne Moss",Actor
----

You also need to reference the appropriate ID space in your relationships file so it knows which nodes to connect.

.roles7.csv
[source]
----
:START_ID(Actor-ID),role,:END_ID(Movie-ID)
1,"Neo",1
1,"Neo",2
1,"Neo",3
2,"Morpheus",1
2,"Morpheus",2
2,"Morpheus",3
3,"Trinity",1

----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies7.csv --nodes=import/actors7.csv --relationships=ACTED_IN=import/roles7.csv neo4j
----


== Skip relationships referring to missing nodes

The import tool has no tolerance for bad entities (relationships or nodes) and will fail the import on the first bad entity.
You can specify explicitly that you want it to ignore rows that contain bad entities.

There are two different types of bad input:

1. Bad relationships.
2. Bad nodes.

Relationships that refer to missing node IDs, either for `:START_ID` or `:END_ID` are considered bad relationships.
Whether or not such relationships are skipped is controlled with the `--skip-bad-relationships` flag, which can have the values `true` or `false` or no value, which means `true`.
The default is `false`, which means that any bad relationship is considered an error and will fail the import.
For more information, see the `--skip-bad-relationships` option.


[discrete]
=== The data

In the following example, there is a missing `emil` node referenced in the roles file.

.movies8a.csv

[discrete]
=== Importing the data

The call to `neo4j-admin database import` would look like this:

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --nodes=import/movies8a.csv --nodes=import/actors8a.csv --relationships=import/roles8a.csv neo4j
----

Because there is a bad relationship in the input data, the import process will fail.

Let's see what happens if you append the `--skip-bad-relationships` flag:

.shell
[source]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database import full --skip-bad-relationships --nodes=import/movies8a.csv --nodes=import/actors8a.csv --relationships=import/roles8a.csv neo4j
----

The data files are successfully imported and the bad relationship is ignored.
An entry is written to the `import.report` file.

.ignore bad relationships
[source]
----
InputRelationship:
   source: roles8a.csv:11
   properties: [role, Emil]
   startNode: emil (global id space)
   endNode: tt0133093 (global id space)
   type: ACTED_IN
 referring to missing node emil
----


== Skip nodes with the same ID

Nodes that specify `:ID`, which has already been specified within the ID space are considered bad nodes.
Whether or not such nodes are skipped is controlled with `--skip-duplicate-nodes` flag which can have the values `true` or `false` or no value, which means `true`.
The default is `false`, which means that any duplicate node is considered an error and will fail the import.
For more information, see the `--skip-duplicate-nodes` option.


[discrete]
=== The data

In the following example there is a node ID, `laurence`, that is specified twice within the same ID space.
