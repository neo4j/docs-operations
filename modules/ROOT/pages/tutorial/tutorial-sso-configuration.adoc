= Configuring Neo4j Single Sign-On (SSO)
:description: Detailed examples of how to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for several identity providers. It also presents frequently asked questions and solutions to common problems encountered when configuring SSO.

Neo4j supports SSO authentication and authorization through identity providers implementing the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard.
This page features detailed examples of how to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for several identity providers.
It also presents frequently asked questions and solutions to common problems encountered when configuring SSO.

[NOTE]
====
The following configurations are crafted for a Neo4j Browser served on `http://localhost:7474/browser/` (the default URL when starting the database on `localhost`).

Therefore, when reproducing them in the identity providers, you must modify the redirect URI to include the URI serving your Neo4j Browser application.
For example:

`+++http://localhost:7474/browser/?idp_id={provider}&auth_flow_step=redirect_uri+++`
====

SSO works in the following way:

. The server (Neo4j DBMS) contacts the identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, Google, etc.) and fetches the JSON Web Keys (JWKs) from the provider.
. The client (e.g., Bloom, Neo4j Browser, etc.) asks the user for credentials and contacts the identity provider.
. The identity provider responds with a JSON Web Token (JWT), a JSON file containing fields (claims) relative to the user (email, audience, groups, etc.).
. The client provides the server with the JWT, and the server verifies its signature with the JWKs.
. label:new[Introduced in 5.24] Optionally, you can control the authentication and authorization on a user level by setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.require_local_user[`dbms.security.require_local_user`] to `true` in the _neo4j.conf_ file and the xref:authentication-authorization/auth-providers.adoc[auth providers] for the users, which authentication and authorization you want to control, using Cypher.
This setting mandates that users with the relevant auth provider attached to them must exist in the database before they can authenticate and authorize with that auth provider.
For information on how to modify or create users in this mode, see xref:authentication-authorization/manage-users.adoc[Manage users]. +
This mode allows you the following using Cypher:
.. Suspend SSO users.
.. Set a home database for an SSO user.
.. Set a user-friendly name for an SSO user (rather than relying on the external identifier).
.. Set a password for an SSO user.
.. Set a password change requirement for an SSO user.

For further information and examples, see xref:authentication-authorization/sso-integration.adoc#auth-sso-auth-providers[Configure SSO at the user level using auth providers].

[IMPORTANT]
====
JWTs must *always* contain a value for `sub` even when using a different claim for `username`.
It is the only claim guaranteed to be unique and stable.
Other claims, such as `email` or `preferred_username` are less secure and may change over time.
They should *not* be used for authentication.
Neo4j may assign permissions to a user based on this username value in a hybrid authorization configuration.
Thus, changing the username claim from `sub` is not recommended.

== Okta

=== Access token

This example shows how to configure Okta for authentication and authorization using access tokens.

. Configure the client with the appropriate redirect URI.
You can skip the group assignments in this step:

+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-okta-client-config-a.png[title="Okta OIDC client configuration"]

. Take note of the Client ID and the Okta domain.
You will need them later when configuring the Okta parameters and the Well-known OpenID Connect endpoint in the _neo4j.conf_ file:
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-okta-client-config-b.png[title="Okta OIDC client configuration"]

. Create groups in Okta, assign users to them (the user can be added to a group either on user creation or editing the group), and map them in the `neo4j.conf` to native groups:
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-okta-server-groups.png[title="Okta OIDC server groups"]

. Configure the default authorization server (the one that shows `api://default` as audience) to return the `groups` claim in access tokens:

=== ID token

This example shows how to configure Okta for authentication and authorization using ID tokens.

. Follow the first two steps from the instructions for xref:#_access_token[Access token].

. Create the claims as indicated:
+

== Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)

=== Access token

This example shows how to configure Entra ID for authentication and authorization using an access token.

. After the successful creation of your SSO application in Azure, open the *Token configuration* tab to configure a token.
.. Click *Add groups claim*.
.. Select *Security groups* to include in your access token.
.. Save your changes.

. Open the **Expose an API** tab and select **Add a Scope**.
.. If you click the **Add a Scope** button for the first time, you see a new pane stating that you need to add an _Application ID URI_ before proceeding.
+
You can find it on your app *Overview* page.
+
.The GUID is used to identify specific resources or instances within Azure. You can find it on the app registration page.
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/azure-id.svg[]
+
.. Click *Save and continue* after setting the _Application ID URI_.

. Fill in all mandatory fields in the pane **Add a scope**.
.. Enter a new *Scope name*, *Admin consent display name*, and *Admin consent description*.
.. Make sure the *Enabled* scope state is selected.
.. Select the *Add scope* button again to create a new scope.
You can add all scopes supported by your API.
+
Once the scopes are created, make a note of them for use later.

. Configure Neo4j to use Entra ID for authentication by configuring the following settings in the _neo4j.conf_ file:
+

=== ID token

This example shows how to configure Entra ID for authentication and authorization using ID tokens.

==== Register the application

. Log in to the https://portal.azure.com/#home[Azure portal].
. Navigate to *Microsoft Entra ID > Overview*.
. From the *Add* dropdown menu, select *App registration* and fill in the following information to create your SSO application:
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-azure-client-creation.png[title="Entra OIDC client creation"]
The redirect URI `http://localhost:7474/browser/?idp_id=azure&auth_flow_step=redirect_uri` is the URI that will accept returned token responses after successful authentication.
. Click *Register*.


==== Configure Neo4j
. After the successful app creation, on the app's *Overview* page, find the Application (client) ID value. Use it to configure the following properties in the _neo4j.conf_ file.
+
[source, properties]

. Configure which JWT claim should be used for usernames. Possible values are `sub`, `email`, or `preferred_username`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
`sub` is the only claim guaranteed to be unique and stable.

==== Map Entra groups to Neo4j roles

Decide whether you want to use Entra groups directly or Entra App Roles.

Using Entra groups directly might be convenient if you already have users assigned to those groups and want to perform Group-to-Role mapping in Neo4j settings.

Entra App Roles allow a layer of separation between Neo4j roles and groups.
When App Roles are used, only the roles relevant to Neo4j are sent in the JWT token.
This prevents leaking permissions between applications.
JWT tokens also have a limitation of 200 roles per token per user, which can be avoided by sending only the relevant App Roles.

Details about Entra ID App Roles can be found in the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps[Microsoft documentation].

==== Using Entra groups directly

. Configure the server to return the Group Object IDs in the JWT identity tokens.
To do this, set `groupMembershipClaims` to `SecurityGroup` in the Manifest of the registered application:
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-azure-server-claims.png[title="Entra OIDC server claims"]

. Create groups in the Entra AD console and assign users to them.
Take note of the Object Id column.
In the next step, you must map these to user roles in the Neo4j settings.
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-azure-server-groups.png[title="Entra OIDC server groups"]

. Configure a mapping from Entra Group Object IDs to Neo4j roles.

==== Using Entra ID App roles

. On the app's home page, navigate to *App roles* and add the Neo4j roles to the Microsoft Entra ID.
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-azure-app-roles.png[title="Entra OIDC app roles config"]

. The *Value* column in the App roles config must either correspond to Neo4j roles or be mapped in the _neo4j.conf_ file.

== Google

=== ID token

This example shows how to use Google OpenID Connect for authentication using ID tokens in conjunction with native authorization.

. Configure the client and the redirect URI:
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-google-client-creation.png[title="Google OIDC client creation"]
+
image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-google-client-config.png[title="Google OIDC client configuration"]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
SSO authorization does not work with Google, as the JWT returned by Google does not contain information about the groups that a user belongs to, and cannot be configured to.
Therefore, it is recommended to use native (or another flavor) authorization by creating a native version of the user in Neo4j.
====

. Configure Neo4j to use Google authentication by setting the following configurations in the _neo4j.conf_ file:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-google
dbms.security.authorization_providers=native
dbms.security.oidc.google.display_name=Google

----

. Using one of the following options, create a user in the database who can authenticate and authorize natively to be able to give the users roles from native authorization.
+
[.tabbed-example]
=====
[.include-with-auth-providers]
======
label:new[Introduced in 5.24]

This approach relies on the existence of an admin user who can authenticate natively and then create less privileged users via xref:authentication-authorization/auth-providers.adoc[auth providers], who can authenticate only using `oidc-google`, but will receive the roles granted to them using `native` authorization.

[NOTE]
====
An admin user with the name `neo4j` is created by default when the database is xref:configuration/set-initial-password.adoc[first started].
====

. In the _neo4j.conf_ file, temporarily enable native authentication for the `admin` user only and enable the user-level control of authentication and authorization:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-google, native
dbms.security.require_local_user=true
----
This will switch to __user auth providers__ mode whereby users can only authenticate and authorize if they have a corresponding auth provider in the database.

. Create a user who can authenticate and authorize only using `oidc-google`:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE USER jake
SET HOME DATABASE 'jakesHomeDb'
SET AUTH 'oidc-google' {SET ID 'jakesUniqueGoogleUserId'} # <1>
----
+
<1> `jakesUniqueGoogleUserId` must match the value of the claim that you configured via `dbms.security.oidc.google.claims.username`.

. Grant the user `jake` roles, for example, `reader`:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ROLE reader TO jake
----
+
The user implicitly receives `native` authorization because `native` is in the list of authorization providers and you have explicitly granted the user a role.

. Once you have set up your users in this way, you can disable native authentication for the database completely.
This will prevent all users, including the admin, from logging in with a username and password:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-google
----

======

[.include-with-native-authentication]

Alternatively, if you do not use auth providers, you can temporarily enable `native` authentication to create an SSO-authenticated admin user `alice` who can then create other users who can only authenticate using SSO.

. Temporarily enable `native` authentication:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-google, native

. Create an SSO-authenticated `admin` user (in this example an equivalent of `alice@neo4j-test.com` must be set up in the Google SSO provider and their credentials must be known):
+
[source]
----
CREATE USER `alice@neo4j-test.com` SET PASSWORD 'secretpassword';

== FAQ

=== When should `pkce` be used as auth flow?
Assuming the client (Neo4j Browser or Bloom) can be accessed through the public internet, always use `pkce` auth-flow rather than `implicit` because the latter requires the client's secret to be available to the public client.
In general, if both flows are available, it is recommended to opt for `pkce` because it is more secure than `implicit`.

=== Is Google authentication secure if it has a client secret listed in the config?
Yes.
Google uses the pkce flow, but identity providers sometimes also use a client secret to ensure the client asking for a token is the one using it (pkce does not guarantee that).
The client secret does not add any additional security as it is public but the `pkce` flow provides sufficient security.

=== Could not parse JWT of type "access_token"
When getting the message `Failed to get credentials: Could not parse JWT of type "access_token"` on Browser, it probably means the provider only accepts ID tokens.

image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-access-token-error.png[title="Failed to parse JWT of type access_token"]

Change to ID tokens in your _neo4j.conf_:

[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.{{provider}}.config=token_type_principal=id_token;token_type_authentication=id_token
----

=== When should identity tokens vs. access tokens be used?
It is generally safer to use access tokens when possible due to being shorter-lived.
If authorization permissions change on the identity provider, Neo4j will fail authorization.
Neo4j Browser will try to reconnect and reflect the changed permissions faster than if ID tokens were used.

=== Debug logging of JWT claims

While setting up an OIDC integration, it is sometimes necessary to perform troubleshooting.
In these cases, it can be useful to view the claims contained in the JWT supplied by the identity provider.
To enable the logging of these claims at `DEBUG` level in the security log, set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled[dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled] to `true` and the security log level to `DEBUG`.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure to set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled[dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled] back to `false` for production environments to avoid unwanted logging of potentially sensitive information.
Also, bear in mind that the set of claims provided by an identity provider in the JWT can change over time.
====

=== How to debug further problems with the configuration
Apart from the logs available in _logs/debug.log_ and _logs/security.log_ in the Neo4j path, you can also use the web-development console in your web browser when doing the SSO authentication flow with Bloom or Neo4j Browser.
This could reveal potential problems, such as the one presented below with an example identity provider and the Cross-Origin Request policy:

image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-cors-error.png[title="CORS error"]

The solution involves adding the redirect domain to the list of allowed domains in the provider (in this case, `localhost:8080`):

image::sso-configuration-tutorials/oidc-cors-error-solution.png[title="CORS error solution allowing the redirect domain on the provider"]
