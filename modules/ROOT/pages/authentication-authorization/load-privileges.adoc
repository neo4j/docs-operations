= Load privileges

_This feature is available from Neo4j 5.13._

This section explains how to use Cypher to manage load privileges.
All load privileges apply to the whole system.
Like DBMS privileges, they do not belong to one specific database or graph.
For more details on the differences between graphs, databases, and the DBMS, refer to link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/introduction/cypher_neo4j/[Cypher Manual -> Cypher and Neo4j].

The load privileges apply to the Cypher link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/load-csv/[`LOAD CSV` clause], deciding whether or not the data can be loaded from the given source.

== Load privileges syntax

The load privileges are assigned using Cypher administrative commands.
They can be granted, denied, and revoked in the same way as other privileges.
For more details, see xref:authentication-authorization/manage-privileges.adoc[RBAC and fine-grained privileges].

Unlike other privileges, the `LOAD` privilege is not granted, denied, or revoked on `DBMS`, `DATABASE`, or `GRAPH`, but instead on the data source to load from.
Adding `ON ALL DATA` means a role has the privilege to load data from all sources.
To only allow loading data from sources given by a specific CIDR range use `ON CIDR cidr`.

[[access-control-load-all-data]]
== The `ALL DATA` privilege

The load privilege on `ALL DATA` enables or disables loading data.
If granted, the user can load data from any source.
If missing or denied, no data can be loaded at all.

The `LOAD ON ALL DATA` privilege is granted to the `PUBLIC` role by default.

[[access-control-load-cidr]]
== The `CIDR` privilege

_This feature is available from Neo4j 5.16._

The load privilege on `CIDR cidr` enables or disables loading data from the given IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range.
If granted, the user can load data from sources in the given CIDR range.
If missing or denied, no data can be loaded from sources in the given CIDR range.

.Denies users with the role `roleLoadCidr` the ability to load data with `LOAD CSV` from `127.0.0.1/32`
====
