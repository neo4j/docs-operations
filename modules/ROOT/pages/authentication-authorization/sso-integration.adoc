= Single sign-on integration
:description: This page describes Neo4j support for integrating with SSO identity providers using OpenID Connect.

Neo4j supports OpenID Connect (OIDC), which allows for integration with many identity providers including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google.
This integration permits federated users, managed by the identity provider, to access Neo4j instead of, or in addition to the native users and roles.
For examples with different providers and troubleshooting, see the xref:tutorial/tutorial-sso-configuration.adoc[SSO configuration tutorial].

[[auth-sso-parameters]]
== OIDC configuration settings

Neo4j supports multiple OIDC identity providers at the same time, as such each provider configuration must be assigned a prefix to differentiate it from others.
In the configuration examples below the provider-specific prefix is represented by `<provider>`, which should be replaced with a name representing your provider.
For example, if you are using Okta as your identity provider you might use `okta` in the place of `<provider>` below.

The following configuration settings are important to consider when configuring single sign-on.
For a more detailed overview of the single sign-on configuration options, see xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc[Configuration settings].
Some of these settings can also be updated while the database is running, see xref:configuration/dynamic-settings.adoc[Dynamic settings] for more information on how to do this.
Altering any of these settings causes users to re-authenticate as their permissions may have changed as a result.

== Configure Neo4j to use OpenID Connect

First, you configure Neo4j to use OpenID Connect as an authentication and authorization provider in the _neo4j.conf_ file.

. Make sure security is turned on.
The default value for `dbms.security.auth_enabled` is `true`.
. Uncomment the settings `dbms.security.authentication_providers` and `dbms.security.authorization_providers` and change their value to `oidc-<provider>`, where `<provider>` maps to the provider name used in the configuration settings.
This way, the OIDC connector is used as a security provider for both authentication and authorization.
If you want, you can still use the `native` provider for mixed-mode authentication and authorization.
The values are comma-separated and queried in the declared order.
+
.Configure Neo4j to use two OpenID Connect and the native authentication and authorization providers.

----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-newsso,oidc-oldsso,native
dbms.security.authorization_providers=oidc-newsso,oidc-oldsso,native
----
======
. Check connectivity.
Neo4j needs to connect to the identity provider to discover settings and fetch public keys to verify tokens.
Check firewall settings and security controls, and, if necessary, logs to ensure that the Neo4j server is able to connect to the identity provider using HTTPS.
If a proxy is required, this can be https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html#Proxies[configured] in the Java virtual machine using the configuration setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.jvm.additional[server.jvm.additional].
Proxies that require credentials are not supported.

[[auth-sso-map-idp-roles]]
== Map the Identity Provider Groups to the Neo4j Roles

Before identity provider managed groups can be used with Neo4j, you have to decide on an approach for mapping identity provider groups to Neo4j roles.
The simplest approach is to create identity provider groups with the same names as Neo4j roles.
If you decide to go this way, no mapping configuration is necessary.
Assuming, however, that identity provider groups do not directly map 1:1 to the desired Neo4j roles, it is necessary to map the identity provider groups to the xref:authentication-authorization/built-in-roles.adoc[Neo4j built-in] and custom-defined roles.
To do that, you need to know what privileges the Neo4j roles have, and based on these privileges, create the mapping to the groups defined in the identity provider.
The map must be formatted as a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, where the key is a comma-separated list of the identity provider group names and the value is a comma-separated list of the corresponding role names.
For example, `group1=role1;group2=role2;group3=role3,role4,role5;group4,group5=role6`.

<3> Mapping of two identity provider groups to a Neo4j built-in role.
<4> Mapping of an identity provider group to a custom-defined role.
Custom-defined roles, such as `rolename`, must be explicitly created using the `CREATE ROLE rolename` command before they can be used to grant privileges.
See xref:authentication-authorization/manage-roles.adoc[Manage roles].

[[auth-sso-configure-provider]]
== Configure Neo4j to use an OpenID Connect Identity Provider

This option allows users to log in through an OIDC compliant identity provider by offering a token from the provider instead of a username and password.
Typically, these tokens take the form of a signed JSON Web Token (JWT).
In the configuration examples below, we are using `mysso` as our provider name.
It is recommended to use a name describing the provider that is being integrated.

[[auth-sso-configure-provider-jwt]]
=== OpenID Connect Using JWT Claims

In this configuration, Neo4j receives a JWT from the identity provider containing claims representing the database username (e.g. email), and the Neo4j roles.

. Set a display name.
+
In the _neo4j.conf_ file, uncomment and configure the following settings:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.display_name=SSO Provider
----
This is displayed on a button on the login page of clients such as Neo4j Browser and Bloom, so that users can identify the provider they are using to login.

. Configure discovery.
+
Uncomment and configure the following settings:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.well_known_discovery_uri=https://my-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
----
The `well_known_discovery` endpoint of the identity provider supplies the OpenID Provider Metadata to allow Neo4j to interact with a provider.
It is also possible to configure the provider settings manually:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.auth_endpoint=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/auth
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.token_endpoint=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/token
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.jwks_uri=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/certs
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.user_info_uri=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/userinfo
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.issuer=abcd1234
----
Manual settings always take priority over those retrieved from the discovery endpoint.

. Configure audience.
+
Provide the expected value for the audience(`aud`) claim:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.audience=myaudience
----
In some situations there may be multiple values for the `aud` claim.
In this situation, the id_token should contain an authorized party(`azp`) claim containing the client id, which is configured as follows:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.client_id=myclientid
----

. Configure claims.
+
Provide the name of the claims that map to the database username and roles.
`username` is expected to be a string claim, and `roles` is expected to be a list of strings representing a set of roles or a single string representing a single role:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.username=sub
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.groups=roles
----

. Optionally, map the groups in the OIDC groups claim to the Neo4j built-in and custom roles.
+
See xref:authentication-authorization/sso-integration.adoc#auth-sso-map-idp-roles[Map the Identity Provider Groups to the Neo4j Roles].

[[auth-sso-configure-provider-userinfo]]
=== OpenID Connect Fetching Claims from Provider

In this configuration, Neo4j receives a token from the identity provider and uses that token to call back to the identity provider using its _UserInfo_ endpoint to retrieve claims for the database username and Neo4j roles.

. Configure Neo4j for xref:authentication-authorization/sso-integration.adoc#auth-sso-configure-provider-jwt[OpenID Connect Using JWT Claims].

. Configure the claims to fetch from the _UserInfo_ endpoint:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.get_username_from_user_info=true
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.get_groups_from_user_info=true
----
It is possible to fetch just the username, just the groups, or both from the userinfo endpoint.

[[auth-sso-self-signed-certificate]]
== Use a self-signed certificate (SSL) in a test environment

Production environments should always use an SSL certificate issued by a Certificate Authority for secure access to the identity provider.
However, there are scenarios, for example in test environments, where you may want to use a self-signed SSL certificate on the identity provider server.

To configure a self-signed SSL certificate used on an identity provider server, enter the details of a Java keystore containing the relevant  certificates using `server.jvm.additional` in _neo4j.conf_.
The path to the certificate file `MyCert.jks` is an absolute path to the Neo4j server.

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/MyCert.jks
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=mypasword
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/MyCert.jks
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=mypasword
----

[[auth-sso-debug-jwt-claims]]
== Debug logging of JWT claims

While setting up an OIDC integration, it is sometimes necessary to perform troubleshooting.
In these cases, it can be useful to view the claims contained in the JWT supplied by the identity provider.
To enable the logging of these claims at `DEBUG` level in the security log, set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled[dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled] to be `true` and the security log level to `DEBUG`.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure to set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled[dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled] back to `false` for production environments to avoid unwanted logging of potentially sensitive information.
Also, bear in mind that the set of claims provided by an identity provider in the JWT can change over time.
