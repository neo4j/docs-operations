= Single sign-on integration
:description: This page describes Neo4j support for integrating with SSO identity providers using OpenID Connect.

Neo4j supports OpenID Connect (OIDC), which allows for integration with many identity providers including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google.
This integration permits federated users, managed by the identity provider, to access Neo4j instead of, or in addition to the native users and roles.
For examples with different providers and troubleshooting, see the xref:tutorial/tutorial-sso-configuration.adoc[SSO configuration tutorial].

[[auth-sso-parameters]]
== OIDC configuration settings

Neo4j supports multiple OIDC identity providers at the same time, as such each provider configuration must be assigned a prefix to differentiate it from others.
In the configuration examples below the provider-specific prefix is represented by `<provider>`, which should be replaced with a name representing your provider.
For example, if you are using Okta as your identity provider you might use `okta` in the place of `<provider>` below.

The following configuration settings are important to consider when configuring single sign-on.
For a more detailed overview of the single sign-on configuration options, see xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc[Configuration settings].
Some of these settings can also be updated while the database is running, see xref:configuration/dynamic-settings.adoc[Dynamic settings] for more information on how to do this.
Altering any of these settings causes users to re-authenticate as their permissions may have changed as a result.

[[auth-sso-configure-sso]]
== Configure Neo4j to use OpenID Connect

First, you configure Neo4j to use OpenID Connect as an authentication and authorization provider in the _neo4j.conf_ file.

. Make sure security is turned on.
The default value for `dbms.security.auth_enabled` is `true`.
. Uncomment the settings `dbms.security.authentication_providers` and `dbms.security.authorization_providers` and change their value to `oidc-<provider>`, where `<provider>` maps to the provider name used in the configuration settings.
This way, the OIDC connector is used as a security provider for both authentication and authorization.
If you want, you can still use the `native` provider for mixed-mode authentication and authorization.
The values are comma-separated and queried in the declared order.
+
.Configure Neo4j to use two OpenID Connect and the native authentication and authorization providers.

----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-newsso,oidc-oldsso,native

----
======
. Check connectivity.
Neo4j needs to connect to the identity provider to discover settings and fetch public keys to verify tokens.
Check firewall settings and security controls, and, if necessary, logs to ensure that the Neo4j server is able to connect to the identity provider using HTTPS.
If a proxy is required, this can be https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html#Proxies[configured] in the Java virtual machine using the configuration setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.jvm.additional[server.jvm.additional].
Proxies that require credentials are not supported.

[[auth-sso-map-idp-roles]]
== Map the identity provider groups to the Neo4j roles

Before identity provider managed groups can be used with Neo4j, you have to decide on an approach for mapping identity provider groups to Neo4j roles.
The simplest approach is to create identity provider groups with the same names as Neo4j roles.
If you decide to go this way, no mapping configuration is necessary.
Assuming, however, that identity provider groups do not directly map 1:1 to the desired Neo4j roles, it is necessary to map the identity provider groups to the xref:authentication-authorization/built-in-roles.adoc[Neo4j built-in] and custom-defined roles.
To do that, you need to know what privileges the Neo4j roles have, and based on these privileges, create the mapping to the groups defined in the identity provider.
The map must be formatted as a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, where the key is the identity provider group name and the value is a comma-separated list of the corresponding role names.
For example, `group1=role1;group2=role2;group3=role3,role4,role5;group4=role6;group5=role6`.

Custom-defined roles, such as `rolename`, must be explicitly created using the `CREATE ROLE rolename` command before they can be used to grant privileges.
See xref:authentication-authorization/manage-roles.adoc[Manage roles].
====

[[auth-sso-configure-provider]]
== Configure Neo4j to use an OpenID Connect identity provider

This option allows users to log in through an OIDC compliant identity provider by offering a token from the provider instead of a username and password.
Typically, these tokens take the form of a signed JSON Web Token (JWT).
The following configuration examples use `mysso` as the provider's name.
It is recommended to use a name describing the provider that is being integrated.

[[auth-sso-configure-provider-jwt]]
=== OpenID Connect using JWT claims

In this configuration, Neo4j receives a JWT from the identity provider containing claims representing the database username (e.g. email), and the Neo4j roles.

. Set a display name.
+
In the _neo4j.conf_ file, uncomment and configure the following settings:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.display_name=SSO Provider
----
This is displayed on a button on the login page of clients, such as Neo4j Browser and Bloom so that you can identify the provider you are using to login.

. Configure discovery.
+
Uncomment and configure the following settings:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.well_known_discovery_uri=https://my-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
----
The `well_known_discovery` endpoint of the identity provider supplies the OpenID provider metadata to allow Neo4j to interact with that provider.
It is also possible to configure the provider settings manually:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.auth_endpoint=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/auth
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.token_endpoint=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/token
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.jwks_uri=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/certs
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.user_info_uri=https://my-idp.example.com/openid-connect/userinfo
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.issuer=abcd1234
----
Manual settings always take priority over those retrieved from the discovery endpoint.

. Configure audience.
+
Provide the expected value for the audience(`aud`) claim:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.audience=myaudience
----

. Configure claims.
+
Provide the name of the claims that map to the database username and roles.
`username` is expected to be a string claim, and `roles` is expected to be a list of strings representing a set of roles or a single string representing a single role:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.username=sub
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.groups=roles
----

. Optionally, map the groups in the OIDC groups claim to the Neo4j built-in and custom roles.
+
See <<auth-sso-map-idp-roles, Map the identity provider groups to the Neo4j roles>>


[[auth-sso-configure-provider-userinfo]]
=== OpenID Connect fetching claims from a provider

In this configuration, Neo4j receives a token from the identity provider and uses that token to call back to the identity provider using its _UserInfo_ endpoint to retrieve claims for the database username and Neo4j roles.

. Configure Neo4j for xref:authentication-authorization/sso-integration.adoc#auth-sso-configure-provider-jwt[OpenID Connect Using JWT Claims].

. Configure the claims to fetch from the _UserInfo_ endpoint:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.get_username_from_user_info=true
dbms.security.oidc.mysso.get_groups_from_user_info=true
----
+
It is possible to fetch just the username, just the groups, or both from the userinfo endpoint.

[[auth-sso-auth-providers]]
=== Configure SSO at the user level using auth providers
xref:authentication-authorization/auth-providers.adoc[User auth providers] can be used to determine which users can authenticate and authorize using the configured providers.

You must change the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.require_local_user[`dbms.security.require_local_user`] configuration setting to `true` to use auth providers.
This means that a user with a matching auth provider *must* exist in order to be able to authenticate and authorize.
This applies to all providers.

Conversely, when xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.require_local_user[`dbms.security.require_local_user`] is set to `false`, users' auth providers have no bearing on the way that they are authenticated and authorized, instead authentication and authorization is controlled centrally (for all users) by the database configuration.

The following examples show how to configure users with auth provider using Cypher.

.Create a user with an auth provider who can authenticate and authorize using `mysso`
======
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
CREATE USER jake
SET AUTH 'oidc-mysso' {SET ID 'jakesUniqueMySsoId'} // the id must match the claim that you configured via dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.username
----

The command creates the user `jake` who can authenticate and authorize using `mysso` provided they present a valid token with a `sub` claim of `jakesUniqueMySsoId`.
The claim used for authentication is determined by the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.oidc.-provider-.claims.username[`dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.username`] config setting (the default is the `sub` claim).
======


.Create a user with two auth providers allowing the user to authenticate and authorize with one of them
======
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
CREATE USER jake
SET HOME DATABASE anotherDb
SET AUTH 'oidc-mysso1' {SET ID 'jakesUniqueMySso1Id'} // `jakesUniqueMySso1Id` must match the value of the claim that you configured via dbms.security.oidc.mysso1.claims.username
SET AUTH 'oidc-mysso2' {SET ID 'jakesUniqueMySso2Id'} // `jakesUniqueMySso2Id` must match the value of the claim that you configured via dbms.security.oidc.mysso2.claims.username
----
The command creates the user `jake` who can authenticate and authorize using `mysso1` or `mysso2`.
The example also illustrates that the user can have their home database set even when using only external auth providers.
======


.Alter a user to remove one of their auth providers
======
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
ALTER USER jake
REMOVE AUTH 'oidc-mysso2'
----
The command prevents the user `jake` from being able to authenticate and authorize with the `mysso2` provider.
======

.Alter a user to allow them to authenticate and authorize using username and password
======
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
ALTER USER jake
SET AUTH 'native' {SET PASSWORD 'changeme' SET PASSWORD CHANGE REQUIRED}
----
The command allows the user `jake` to authenticate and authorize using the specified username and password (in addition to what they are already configured to use).
======


.Configure the database to allow authentication via `mysso` and authorization via the `native` provider
======

. Set the following database config:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-mysso
dbms.security.authorization_providers=native
----

. Create a user with a `mysso` auth provider:
+
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
CREATE USER jake
SET AUTH 'oidc-mysso' {SET ID 'jakesUniqueMySsoId'} // `jakesUniqueMySsoId` must match the value of the claim that you configured via dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.username
----

. Natively grant the `READER` role to the user:
+
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
GRANT ROLE READER TO jake
----
+
The command allows the user `jake` to authenticate using `mysso` and receive the `READER` role from the `native` provider.

. You can also give the user the union of roles from `mysso` *and* `native` by setting `mysso` as an authorization provider too:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.authentication_providers=oidc-mysso
dbms.security.authorization_providers=native,oidc-mysso
----
======

.Suspend a user
======
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
ALTER USER jake
SET STATUS SUSPENDED

----
The command completely prevents the user from being able to authenticate/authorize by any means.
======

[[auth-sso-self-signed-certificate]]
== Use a self-signed certificate (SSL) in a test environment

Production environments should always use an SSL certificate issued by a Certificate Authority for secure access to the identity provider.
However, there are scenarios, for example in test environments, where you may want to use a self-signed SSL certificate on the identity provider server.

To configure a self-signed SSL certificate used on an identity provider server, enter the details of a Java keystore containing the relevant  certificates using `server.jvm.additional` in _neo4j.conf_.
The path to the certificate file `MyCert.jks` is an absolute path to the Neo4j server.

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/MyCert.jks
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=mypasword
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/MyCert.jks
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=mypasword

[[auth-sso-debug-jwt-claims]]
== Debug logging of JWT claims

While setting up an OIDC integration, it is sometimes necessary to perform troubleshooting.
In these cases, it can be useful to view the claims contained in the JWT supplied by the identity provider.
To enable the logging of these claims at `DEBUG` level in the security log, set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled[dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled] to be `true` and the security log level to `DEBUG`.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure to set xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled[dbms.security.logs.oidc.jwt_claims_at_debug_level_enabled] back to `false` for production environments to avoid unwanted logging of potentially sensitive information.
Also, bear in mind that the set of claims provided by an identity provider in the JWT can change over time.
====
