= Read privileges

There are three separate read privileges:

* xref:authentication-authorization/privileges-reads.adoc#access-control-privileges-reads-traverse[`TRAVERSE`] - enables the specified entities to be found.
* xref:authentication-authorization/privileges-reads.adoc#access-control-privileges-reads-read[`READ`] - enables the specified properties of the found entities to be read.
* xref:authentication-authorization/privileges-reads.adoc#access-control-privileges-reads-match[`MATCH`] - combines both `TRAVERSE` and `READ`, enabling an entity to be found and its properties read.

[[access-control-privileges-reads-traverse]]
== The `TRAVERSE` privilege

Users can be granted the right to find nodes and relationships using the `GRANT TRAVERSE` privilege.

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] TRAVERSE
  ON { HOME GRAPH | GRAPH[S] { * | name[, ...] } }
    [
      ELEMENT[S] { * | label-or-rel-type[, ...] }
      | NODE[S] { * | label[, ...] }
      | RELATIONSHIP[S] { * | rel-type[, ...] }
    ]
  TO role[, ...]
----

For example, we can enable users with the role `regularUsers` to find all nodes with the label `Post` in the database `neo4j`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT TRAVERSE ON GRAPH neo4j NODES Post TO regularUsers
----

The `TRAVERSE` privilege can also be denied.

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
DENY [IMMUTABLE] TRAVERSE
  ON { HOME GRAPH | GRAPH[S] { * | name[, ...] } }
    [
      ELEMENT[S] { * | label-or-rel-type[, ...] }
      | NODE[S] { * | label[, ...] }
      | RELATIONSHIP[S] { * | rel-type[, ...] }
    ]
  TO role[, ...]
----

For example, we can disable users with the role `regularUsers` from finding all nodes with the label `Payments`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY TRAVERSE ON HOME GRAPH NODES Payments TO regularUsers
----

[NOTE]
====
If a label or a relationship type does not exist in the database, the user cannot use the corresponding privilege until it is created.
See xref:authentication-authorization/limitations.adoc#access-control-limitations-non-existing-labels[Privileges for non-existing labels, relationship types, and property names] for more information.
====


[[access-control-privileges-reads-read]]
== The `READ` privilege

Users can be granted the right to do property reads on nodes and relationships using the `GRANT READ` privilege.
It is very important to note that users can only read properties on entities that they are enabled to find in the first place.

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] READ "{" { * | property[, ...] } "}"
  ON { HOME GRAPH | GRAPH[S] { * | name[, ...] } }
    [
      ELEMENT[S] { * | label-or-rel-type[, ...] }
      | NODE[S] { * | label[, ...] }
      | RELATIONSHIP[S] { * | rel-type[, ...] }
    ]
  TO role[, ...]
----

For example, we can enable user with the role `regularUsers` to read all properties on nodes with the label `Post` in the database `neo4j`.
The `+*+` implies that the ability to read all properties also extends to properties that might be added in the future.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT READ { * } ON GRAPH neo4j NODES Post TO regularUsers
----

[NOTE]
====
Granting property `READ` access does not imply that the entities with that property can be found.
For example, if there is also a `DENY TRAVERSE` present on the same entity as a `GRANT READ`, the entity will not be found by a Cypher `MATCH` statement.
====

The `READ` privilege can also be denied.

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
DENY [IMMUTABLE] READ "{" { * | property[, ...] } "}"
  ON { HOME GRAPH | GRAPH[S] { * | name[, ...] } }
    [
      ELEMENT[S] { * | label-or-rel-type[, ...] }
      | NODE[S] { * | label[, ...] }
      | RELATIONSHIP[S] { * | rel-type[, ...] }
    ]
  TO role[, ...]
----

Although we just granted the role `regularUsers` the right to read all properties, we may want to hide the `secret` property.
The following example shows how to do that:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY READ { secret } ON GRAPH neo4j NODES Post TO regularUsers
----

[NOTE]
====
If a label, a relationship type, or a property name does not exist in the database, the user cannot use the corresponding privilege until it is created.
See xref:authentication-authorization/limitations.adoc#access-control-limitations-non-existing-labels[Privileges for non-existing labels, relationship types, and property names] for more information.
====


[[access-control-privileges-reads-match]]
== The `MATCH` privilege

Users can be granted the right to find and do property reads on nodes and relationships using the `GRANT MATCH` privilege.
This is semantically the same as having both `TRAVERSE` and `READ` privileges.

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT [IMMUTABLE] MATCH "{" { * | property[, ...] } "}"
  ON { HOME GRAPH | GRAPH[S] { * | name[, ...] } }
    [
      ELEMENT[S] { * | label-or-rel-type[, ...] }
      | NODE[S] { * | label[, ...] }
      | RELATIONSHIP[S] { * | rel-type[, ...] }
    ]
  TO role[, ...]
----

For example if you want to grant the ability to read the properties `language` and `length` for nodes with the label `Message`, as well as the ability to find these nodes to the role `regularUsers`, you can use the following `GRANT MATCH` query:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT MATCH { language, length } ON GRAPH neo4j NODES Message TO regularUsers
----

Like all other privileges, the `MATCH` privilege can also be denied.

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
DENY [IMMUTABLE] MATCH "{" { * | property[, ...] } "}"
  ON { HOME GRAPH | GRAPH[S] { * | name[, ...] } }
    [
      ELEMENT[S] { * | label-or-rel-type[, ...] }
      | NODE[S] { * | label[, ...] }
      | RELATIONSHIP[S] { * | rel-type[, ...] }
    ]
  TO role[, ...]
----

Please note that the effect of denying a `MATCH` privilege depends on whether concrete property keys are specified or are `+*+`.
If you specify concrete property keys, then `DENY MATCH` will only deny reading those properties.
Finding the elements to traverse would still be enabled.
If you specify `+*+` instead, then both traversal of the element and all property reads will be disabled.
The following queries will show examples for this.

Denying to read the property `content` on nodes with the label `Message` for the role `regularUsers` would look like the following query.
Although not being able to read this specific property, nodes with that label can still be traversed (and, depending on other grants, other properties on it could still be read).

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY MATCH { content } ON GRAPH neo4j NODES Message TO regularUsers
----

The following query exemplifies how it would look if you wanted to deny both reading all properties and traversing nodes labeled with `Account` in the database `neo4j`:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DENY MATCH { * } ON GRAPH neo4j NODES Account TO regularUsers
----

[NOTE]
====
If a label, a relationship type, or a property name does not exist in the database, the user cannot use the corresponding privilege until it is created.
See xref:authentication-authorization/limitations.adoc#access-control-limitations-non-existing-labels[Privileges for non-existing labels, relationship types, and property names] for more information.
