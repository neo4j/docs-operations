:description: This page provides an overview of authentication and authorization in Neo4j.

This page provides an overview of authentication and authorization in Neo4j.
Authorization is managed using role-based access control (_RBAC_).
Permissions that define access control are assigned to roles, which are in turn assigned to users.

Neo4j has the following auth providers, that can perform user authentication and authorization:

*Native auth provider*::
Neo4j provides a native auth provider that stores user and role information in the `system` database.
The following parameters control this provider:
+
====
* xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_enabled[`dbms.security.auth_enabled`] (Default: `true`) -- Enable auth requirement to access Neo4j. +
+
[NOTE]
If you need to disable authentication, for example, to recover an `admin` user password or assign a user to the `admin` role, make sure you block all network connections during the recovery phase so users can connect to Neo4j only via `localhost`.
For more information, see xref:configuration/password-and-user-recovery.adoc[Password and user recovery].

* xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_lock_time[`dbms.security.auth_lock_time`] (Default: `5s`) -- The amount of time a user account is locked after a configured number of unsuccessful authentication attempts.
* xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_max_failed_attempts[`dbms.security.auth_max_failed_attempts`] (Default: `3`) -- The maximum number of unsuccessful authentication attempts before imposing a user lock for a configured amount of time. +
When triggered, Neo4j logs an error containing a timestamp and the message `failed to log in: too many failed attempts` in the _security.log_.

The Cypher commands to manage users, roles, and permissions are described in detail in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/access-control/[Cypher Manual -> Access control].
Various scenarios that illustrate the use of the native auth provider are available in xref:authentication-authorization/access-control.adoc[Fine-grained access control].

*LDAP auth provider*::
Another way of controlling authentication and authorization is through external security software such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP, which is accessed via the built-in LDAP connector.
A description of the LDAP plugin using Active Directory is available in xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc[Integration with LDAP directory services].

*Single Sign-On provider*::
Some clients wish to centrally manage authentication and authorization for their systems in an identity provider which provides single sign-on for their other systems.
Neo4j supports the popular OpenID Connect mechanism for integrating with identity providers and configuration for that is described in xref:authentication-authorization/sso-integration.adoc[Integration with Single Sign-On Services].

*Custom-built plugin auth providers*::
For clients with specific requirements not satisfied with either native or LDAP, Neo4j provides a plugin option for building custom integrations.
It is recommended that this option is used as part of a custom delivery as negotiated with Neo4j Professional Services.
The plugin is described in link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/java-reference/{page-version}/extending-neo4j/security-plugins#extending-neo4j-security-plugins[Java Reference -> Authentication and authorization plugins].


*Kerberos authentication and single sign-on*::
In addition to LDAP, Native and custom providers, Neo4j supports Kerberos for authentication and single sign-on.
Kerberos support is provided via the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/kerberos-add-on/current/[Neo4j Kerberos Add-On].
