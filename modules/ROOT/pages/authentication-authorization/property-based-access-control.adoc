= Property-based access control

It is possible to create read privileges that are based on properties of nodes.
Each property-based privilege can only be restricted by a single property.
To specify the property/value conditions of the read privilege the `pattern` syntax described below is used,
for more information about read privilege syntax see xref:authentication-authorization/privileges-reads.adoc[read privilege] page.

Adding property-based access control may lead to a significant performance overhead in certain scenarios.
See xref:authentication-authorization/limitations.adoc#property-based-access-control-limitations[Limitations] for more detailed information.
To reduce the performance impact, it is recommended to use the Block Storage format as it is better optimized for the kind of read required for the resolution of property-based privileges.

Some of the factors that can worsen the impact on performance when having property rules are:

* The number of properties on the nodes concerned (more properties = greater performance impact)
* The number of property-based privileges (more property-based privileges = greater performance impact).
* The type of the privilege: `TRAVERSE` property-based privileges have a greater performance impact than `READ` property-based privileges.
* The type of storage medium in operation. The performance impact of property-based privileges will be considerably amplified by accessing disc storage.

For performance-critical scenarios, it is recommended to design privileges based on labels.
For more information, see xref:authentication-authorization/privileges-reads.adoc[Read privileges].

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using property-based access control, ensure the property used for the rule cannot be modified.
Users who can change this property can affect the granted property-based privileges.

Pattern syntax:
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
([var][:label["|" ...]] "{" property: value "}")
| (var[:label["|" ...]]) WHERE [NOT] var.property { { = | <> | > | >= | < | <= } value | IS NULL | IS NOT NULL | IN { "["[value[, ...]]"]" | listParam } }
| (var[:label["|" ...]] WHERE [NOT] var.property { { = | <> | > | >= | < | <= } value | IS NULL | IS NOT NULL | IN { "["[value[, ...]]"]" | listParam } } )
----
[NOTE]
====
For more details about the syntax descriptions, see xref:database-administration/syntax.adoc[Cypher syntax for administration commands].
====
[NOTE]
====
The role does not need to have `READ` privilege for the property used by the property-based privilege.
====
You can use this pattern syntax for defining read privileges as follows:

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT ... ON GRAPH ... FOR pattern TO ...
----


.Granting permission to `READ` the `address` property on `Email` or `Website` nodes with domain `exampledomain.com` to role `regularUsers`:
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT READ { address } ON GRAPH * FOR (n:Email|Website) WHERE n.domain = 'exampledomain.com' TO regularUsers
----
Alternatively, you can use the following syntax:
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT READ { address } ON GRAPH * FOR (:Email|Website {domain: 'exampledomain.com'}) TO regularUsers
----


.Granting permission to `TRAVERSE` nodes with label `Email` where property `classification` is `NULL` to role `regularUsers`:
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT TRAVERSE ON GRAPH * FOR (n:Email) WHERE n.classification IS NULL TO regularUsers
----

.Denying permission to `READ` and `TRAVERSE` nodes where the property `classification` is different from `UNCLASSIFIED` to role `regularUsers`:
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
DENY MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * FOR (n) WHERE n.classification <> 'UNCLASSIFIED' TO regularUsers
----

.Granting permission to `READ` all properties on nodes where the property `securityLevel` is higher than `3` to role `regularUsers`:
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
GRANT READ {*} ON GRAPH * FOR (n) WHERE n.securityLevel > 3 TO regularUsers
----
[NOTE]
====
The role `regularUsers` does not need to have `READ` privilege for the property `securityLevel` used by the property-based privilege.
====

.Denying permission to `READ` all properties on nodes where the property `classification` is not included in the list of `[UNCLASSIFIED, PUBLIC]`
[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
DENY READ {*} ON GRAPH * FOR (n) WHERE NOT n.classification IN ['UNCLASSIFIED', 'PUBLIC'] TO regularUsers
----
