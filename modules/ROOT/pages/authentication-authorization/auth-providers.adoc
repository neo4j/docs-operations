= User auth providers

Authentication and authorization can be controlled on a user level using Cypher by setting auth providers on users.

To use auth providers, you need to set the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.require_local_user[`dbms.security.require_local_user`] configuration setting to `true`.
This setting mandates that users with the relevant auth provider attached to them must exist in the database before they can authenticate and authorize with that auth provider.

User auth providers allow you to link externally-defined users (e.g., in a third-party ID provider like OIDC or LDAP) to the Neo4j internal user model.
The internal model can define roles (authorization), `SUSPENDED` status, `HOME DATABASE`, and metadata such as the unique displayed name of the user.
For consistency, you can also define `native` (password-based) auth using the auth provider syntax, including native-only users (i.e., users who can only authenticate with a password).

== Use cases

User auth providers can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

* Provisioning different auth providers (including native username/password auth) for different users.
* Setting an arbitrary easy username for a user while using an external unique identifier (like `sub` for OIDC auths, which itself is not a user-friendly value).
* Setting `HOME DATABASE` for externally authenticated users.
* Setting `SUSPENDED` status for an externally authenticated user.
* Using native authorization to manage roles for externally authenticated users.
* Retaining full control of which users can authenticate from within the database.

== How it works

When a user authenticates, their identifying attributes are checked against the relevant property of the auth providers in the database.
If there is a match, then the user is linked to the Neo4j user and authorized according to the DBMS security configuration settings that match the name of the matching auth provider.

How the matching lookup is done depends on the type of provider.
For example:

* For an OIDC provider, the claim configured by xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.oidc.-provider-.claims.username[`dbms.security.oidc.mysso.claims.username`] (default `sub`) is taken from the token and is used to look up an auth provider whose `ID` and `provider` properties match the `sub` and provider respectively of the OIDC provider.
* For an LDAP provider, the `dn` is used to look up an auth provider with a `provider` property of `ldap` and an `ID` property that matches the supplied `dn`.
* For the `native` (username/password) provider, the supplied username itself is used to look up the auth provider.

== Enabling user auth providers mode

To enable user auth providers mode, set the configuration setting xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.require_local_user[`dbms.security.require_local_user`] to `true`.
This setting mandates that users with the relevant auth provider attached to them must exist in the database before they can authenticate and authorize with that auth provider.

When the user authenticates, Neo4j searches for a user with a matching authentication provider.
If a match is found, the user can log in and be authorized successfully.

== Migrating to auth providers mode

If you have existing users in the database and want to migrate to auth providers mode, you can use the `ALTER USER ... SET AUTH` command to attach an auth provider to each of them.
Until you change `dbms.security.require_local_user` to `true`, this will not impact the users' ability to authenticate and authorize as they always have done.

Once the process of adding auth providers to your users finishes, you can set `dbms.security.require_local_user` to `true` and restart the DBMS to complete the migration.
After this time, only users with a corresponding auth provider in the database will be able to authenticate and authorize.

[NOTE]
====
Existing users created using the original `CREATE USER ... SET PASSWORD` command implicitly have the native (username/password) auth provider, so you do not need to add it explicitly using `SET AUTH`.

To verify which auth providers are attached to a user, use the xref:authentication-authorization/manage-users.adoc#access-control-list-users[`SHOW USERS WITH AUTH`] command.
