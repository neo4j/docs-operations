[[auth-ldap-introduction]]
== Introduction

Neo4j supports LDAP, which allows for integration with Active Directory (AD), OpenLDAP, or other LDAP-compatible authentication services.
This means that you use the LDAP service for managing federated users, while the native Neo4j user and role administration are completely turned off.

The following configuration settings are important to consider when configuring LDAP.
For a more detailed overview of the LDAP configuration options, see xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc[Configuration settings].

[[auth-ldap-parameters]]
== LDAP dynamic configuration settings

The following configuration settings can be updated while the database is running, see xref:configuration/dynamic-settings.adoc[Update dynamic settings].
Altering any of these settings clears the authentication and authorization cache.

[options="header",cols="<,<,<"]
|===
| Parameter name
| Default value
| Description

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template[dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template]
| `+uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com+`
| Convert usernames into LDAP-specific fully qualified names required for logging in.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base[dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base]
| `ou=users,dc=example,dc=com`
| Set the base object or named context to search for user objects.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter[dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter]
| `+(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))+`
| Set an LDAP search filter for a user principal.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes[dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes]
| `memberOf`
| List attribute names of a user object that contains groups to be used for mapping to roles.
Common values: `memberOf` and `gidNumber`.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_enabled[dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_enabled]
| `false`
| This setting determines whether multiple LDAP search results will be processed.
This must be set to `true` in order to resolve nested group membership.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping[dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping]
|
| List an authorization mapping from groups to the pre-defined built-in roles `admin`, `architect`, `publisher`, `editor`, and `reader`, or to any other custom-defined roles.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authentication.attribute[dbms.security.ldap.authentication.attribute]
| `samaccountname`
| Set the attribute to search for users with a system account.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authorization.access_permitted_group[dbms.security.ldap.authorization.access_permitted_group]
|
| Set an LDAP group of users with access rights.
Users passing authentication are mapped to at least the `PUBLIC` role in addition to any roles assigned by the
xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc#auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles[group to role mapping] and have access to the database that those roles provide.
If this attribute is set, users not part of
this LDAP group will fail authentication, even if their credentials are correct.
|===

All settings are defined at server startup time in the default configuration file _xref:configuration/neo4j-conf.adoc[neo4j.conf]_ or can be modified at
runtime using xref:reference/procedures.adoc#procedure_dbms_setconfigvalue[`dbms.setConfigValue()`].


[[auth-ldap-configure-provider]]
== Set Neo4j to use LDAP

First, you configure Neo4j to use LDAP as an authentication and authorization provider.

. Uncomment the setting `dbms.security.auth_enabled=false` and change its value to `true` to turn on the security feature.
. Uncomment the settings `dbms.security.authentication_providers` and `dbms.security.authorization_providers` and change their value to `ldap`.
This way, the LDAP connector is used as a security provider for both authentication and authorization.

[[auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles]]
== Map the LDAP groups to the Neo4j roles

To assign privileges to users based on their LDAP groups, you have to map the LDAP groups to the xref:authentication-authorization/built-in-roles.adoc[Neo4j built-in] and custom-defined roles.
To do that, you need to know what privileges the Neo4j roles have, and based on these privileges, to create the mapping to the groups defined in the LDAP server.
The map must be formatted as a semicolon separated list of key-value pairs, where the key is a comma-separated list of the LDAP group names and the value is a comma-separated list of the corresponding role names.
For example, `group1=role1;group2=role2;group3=role3,role4,role5;group4,group5=role6`.

====

[[auth-ldap-configure-provider-ad]]
== Configure Neo4j to use Active Directory

You configure Neo4j to use the LDAP security provider to access and manage your Active Directory.
There are three alternative ways to do that depending on your specific use case.

[[auth-ldap-configure-provider-ad-uid]]
=== Configure Neo4j to support LDAP user ID authentication

This option allows users to log in with their LDAP user ID.

In the _neo4j.conf_ file, uncomment and configure the following settings:

. Configure LDAP to point to the AD server:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.host=ldap://myactivedirectory.example.com
----

. Provide details on the user structure of the LDAP directory:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template=cn={0},cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=*)(cn={0}))
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=memberOf
----

. Map the groups in the LDAP system to the Neo4j built-in and custom roles.
See xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc#auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles[Map the LDAP groups to the Neo4j roles].

[[auth-ldap-configure-provider-ad-sysaccount]]
=== Configure Neo4j to support attribute authentication

This is an alternative configuration for Active Directory that allows users to log in by providing an attribute to search for, by default `sAMAccountName`.
The attribute has to be unique to be used as a lookup.
You create a system account that has read-only access to the parts of the LDAP directory that you want.
However, it does not need to have access rights to Neo4j or any other systems.

In the _neo4j.conf_ file, uncomment and configure the following settings:

. Configure LDAP to point to the AD server:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.host=ldap://myactivedirectory.example.com
----

. Provide details on the user structure of the LDAP directory (replacing `myattribute` with the actual attribute name):
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=*)(myattribute={0}))
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=memberOf
----

. Map the groups in the LDAP system to the Neo4j built-in and custom roles.
See xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc#auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles[Map the LDAP groups to the Neo4j roles].

. Configure Neo4j to use a system account with read access to all users and groups in the LDAP server.

.. Set `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account` value to `true`.

.. Set `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username` value to the full Distinguished Name (DN) as the `dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template` will not be applied to this username.
For example,
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username=cn=search-account,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
----

.. Configure the LDAP system account password.
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password=mypassword
----

.. Configure which attribute to search for by adding the following lines to the _neo4j.conf_ file (replacing `myattribute` with the actual attribute name):
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authentication.search_for_attribute=true
dbms.security.ldap.authentication.attribute=myattribute
----
.. (Optional) Create an LDAP group to restrict authentication against the database to a subset of LDAP users:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.access_permitted_group=cn=Neo4j Access,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com
----

[[auth-ldap-configure-provider-ad-nosysaccount]]
=== Configure Neo4j to support `sAMAccountName` authentication by setting `user_dn_template`

This is an alternative configuration for Active Directory that allows all users from the specified domain to log in using `sAMAccountName`.
With this option, you do not have to create a system account and store a system username/password in the config file.
Instead, you set `+{0}@example.com+` as a value of the `user_dn_template` to enable the authentication to start at the root domain.
This way, the whole tree is checked to find the user, regardless of where it is located within the LDAP directory tree.

In the _neo4j.conf_ file, uncomment and configure the following settings:

. Configure LDAP to point to the AD server:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.host=ldap://myactivedirectory.example.com
----

. Provide details on the user structure of the LDAP directory:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template={0}@example.com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={0}))
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=memberOf
----
+

. Map the groups in the LDAP system to the Neo4j built-in and custom roles.
For more information, see xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc#auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles[Map the LDAP groups to the Neo4j roles].

[NOTE]
The setting `dbms.security.ldap.authentication.search_for_attribute` should be set to the default value of false.

[[auth-ldap-configure-nested-groups]]
=== Configure Neo4j to perform nested group lookup

When a user is a member of a group (e.g. `engineers`) and that group is a member of another group (e.g. `employees`), Active Directory can be configured to perform a nested search such that a user in the group `engineers` would also be a member of the group `employees`.
This in turn means that it is possible to configure a xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc#auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles[group to role mapping] for `employees` which will transitively apply to `engineers`.

Active Directory facilitates nested search via the extensible match operator `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` (whose Object Identifier is 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941).
This operator walks the chain of ancestry in objects all the way to the root.

To set up nested search in the _neo4j.conf_ file, configure the following settings:

. Enable nested groups.
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_enabled=true
----

. Provide details on the user structure of the LDAP directory:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template=cn={0},cn=users,dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))
----

. Provide the nested groups search filter. +
This is the filter which will be used to perform the nested lookup of the user's groups.
It should contain the placeholder token `{0}`, which will be substituted with the user's Distinguished Name (which is found for the specified user principle using `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter`). +
This example features Active Directory's `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` (aka `1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`) implementation:

+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_search_filter=(&(objectclass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={0}))
----

. Provide group to role mappings, including ancestor groups if required:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping=\
"cn=engineers,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"=procedures;\
"cn=employees,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"=reader
----

[NOTE]
In contrast to a non-nested-LDAP lookup, a nested group lookup does not perform an attribute-based lookup on the user object.
Instead, the `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes` setting is ignored and the `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter` is only used to determine the Distinguished Name of the user.
This is then substituted into the `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.nested_groups_search_filter` to perform a separate, nested lookup of the user's groups.


[[auth-ldap-configure-provider-openldap]]
== Configure Neo4j to use OpenLDAP

You configure the LDAP security provider to access and manage your OpenLDAP directory service.

In the neo4j.conf file, uncomment and configure the following settings:

. Configure LDAP to point to the OpenLDAP server:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.host=myopenldap.example.com
----

. Provide details on the user structure of the LDAP directory:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template=cn={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=*)(uid={0}))
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=gidNumber
----
. (Optional) Create an LDAP group to restrict authentication against the database to a subset of LDAP users:
+
[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.access_permitted_group=501
----

. Map the groups in the LDAP system to the Neo4j built-in and custom roles.
For more information, see xref:authentication-authorization/ldap-integration.adoc#auth-ldap-map-ldap-roles[Map the LDAP groups to the Neo4j roles].

[[auth-ldap-search]]
== Verify the LDAP configuration

You can verify that your LDAP configuration is correct, and that the LDAP server responds, by using the LDAP command-line tool `ldapsearch`.

The `ldapsearch` command accepts the LDAP configuration setting values as input and verifies both the authentication (using the `simple` mechanism) and authorization of a user.
See the https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/tool-usages/ldapsearch.html[ldapsearch official documentation^] for more advanced usage and how to use SASL authentication mechanisms.

. Verify the authentication and authorization of a user.
For example, `john`.

* With `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account=false` (default):
+
[source, shell, role=noplay]
----
# ldapsearch -v -H ldap://<dbms.security.ldap.host> -x -D <dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template : replace {0}> -W -b <dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base> "<dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter : replace {0}>" <dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes>

ldapsearch -v -H ldap://myactivedirectory.example.com:389 -x -D cn=john,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com -W -b cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com "(&(objectClass=*)(cn=john))" memberOf
----

* With `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.use_system_account=true`:
+
[source, shell, role=noplay]
----
# ldapsearch -v -H ldap://<dbms.security.ldap.host> -x -D <dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username> -w <dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password> -b <dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base> "<dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter>" <dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes>

ldapsearch -v -H ldap://myactivedirectory.example.com:389 -x -D cn=search-account,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com -w mypassword -b cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com "(&(objectClass=*)(cn=john))" memberOf
----

. Verify that the value of the returned membership attribute is a group that is mapped to a role in `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping`.
+
[source, properties]
----
# extended LDIF

[[auth-ldap-clear-auth-cache]]
== The auth cache
The _auth cache_ is the mechanism by which Neo4j caches the result of authentication via the LDAP server in order to aid performance.
It is configured with the parameters `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled[dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled]`, and `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl[dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl]`.

[source, properties]
----
# Turn on authentication caching to ensure performance.

dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled=true
dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl=10m
----
.Auth cache parameters
[options="header", cols="<,<,<"]
|===
| Parameter name
| Default value
| Description

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled[dbms.security.ldap.authentication.cache_enabled]
| `true`
| Determines whether or not to cache the result of authentication via the LDAP server.

Whether authentication caching should be enabled or not must be considered in view of your company's security guidelines.

| xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl[dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl]
| `600 seconds`
| Is the time to live (TTL) for cached authentication and authorization info.

Setting the TTL to 0 disables all auth caching.

A short TTL requires more frequent re-authentication and re-authorization, which can impact performance.

A very long TTL means that changes to the users settings on an LDAP server may not be reflected in the Neo4j authorization behaviour in a timely manner.

Valid units are `ms`, `s`, `m`; default unit is `s`.
|===


An administrator can clear the auth cache to force the re-querying of authentication and authorization information from the federated auth provider system.
Use Neo4j Browser or Neo4j Cypher Shell to execute this statement:

[source, cypher]

CALL dbms.security.clearAuthCache()
----

[[auth-ldap-ad-encrypted]]
== Available methods of encryption

Specifying the `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.host[dbms.security.ldap.host]` parameter configures using LDAP without encryption.
Not specifying the protocol or port results in `ldap` being used over the default port `389`.

[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.host=myactivedirectory.example.com
dbms.security.ldap.host=myactivedirectory.example.com:389

[[auth-ldap-encrypted-starttls]]
=== Use LDAP with encryption via StartTLS

To configure Active Directory with encryption via StartTLS, set the following parameters:

[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.use_starttls=true
dbms.security.ldap.host=ldap://myactivedirectory.example.com
----

[[auth-ldap-encrypted-ldaps]]
=== Use LDAP with encrypted LDAPS

To configure Active Directory with encrypted LDAPS, set `xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.security.ldap.host[dbms.security.ldap.host]` to one of the following.
If you do not specify the port, the default one `636` is used.

[source, properties]
----
dbms.security.ldap.host=ldaps://myactivedirectory.example.com
dbms.security.ldap.host=ldaps://myactivedirectory.example.com:636
----

[[auth-ldap-self-signed-certificate]]
== Use a self-signed certificate (SSL) in a test environment

Production environments should always use an SSL certificate issued by a Certificate Authority for secure access to the LDAP server.
However, there are scenarios, for example in test environments, where you may want to use an SSL certificate on the LDAP server.

To configure an SSL certificate on LDAP server, enter the details of the certificate using `server.jvm.additional` in _neo4j.conf_.
The path to the certificate file `MyCert.jks` is an absolute path to the Neo4j server.

[source, properties]
----
server.jvm.additional=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/MyCert.jks
