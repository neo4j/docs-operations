== Introduction

Neo4j provides a set of built-in roles that can be used to control access to the database.
The `PUBLIC` role is the default role for all users.
It does not give any rights or capabilities regarding the data, not even read privileges.
The rest of the built-in roles are hierarchical, with the `reader` role at the bottom and the `admin` role at the top with all privileges.

A user may have more than one assigned role, and the union of these determines what action(s) on the data may be undertaken by the user.
For instance, a user assigned to the `reader` role can execute procedures, because all users are also assigned to the `PUBLIC` role, which enables that capability.

The built-in roles have the following default privileges:

[.compact]
<<access-control-built-in-roles-public, `PUBLIC`>>::
* Access to the home database.
* Execute procedures with the users' own privileges.
* Execute user-defined functions with the users' own privileges.
* Load data.
<<access-control-built-in-roles-reader, `reader`>>::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse and read on the data graph (all nodes, relationships, properties).
* Show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
<<access-control-built-in-roles-editor, `editor`>>::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Write access, limited to creating and changing *existing* property keys, node labels, and relationship types of the graph.
In other words, the `editor` role cannot add to the schema but can only make changes to already existing objects.
* Show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
<<access-control-built-in-roles-publisher, `publisher`>>::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
<<access-control-built-in-roles-architect, `architect`>>::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Create/drop/show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
<<access-control-built-in-roles-admin, `admin`>>::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Load data.
* Create/drop/show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
* Execute procedures using boosted privileges.
* Execute admin procedures.
* Execute user-defined functions using boosted privileges.
* View/terminate queries.
* Manage databases, users, roles, and privileges.


When an administrator suspends or deletes another user, the following rules apply:

* Administrators can suspend or delete any other user (including other administrators), but not themselves.
* When suspended, the user is no longer able to log back in until re-activated by an administrator.
* There is no need to remove assigned roles from a user before deleting the user.

[NOTE]
--
Deleting a user does not automatically terminate associated connections, sessions, transactions, or queries.

Neo4j provides the following built-in roles with default privileges and capabilities.
The subset of the functionality that is available with Community Edition is also included.
All of the commands require that the user executing the commands has the rights to do so.

[[access-control-built-in-roles-public]]
== The `PUBLIC` role

All users are granted the `PUBLIC` role, and it can not be revoked or dropped.
By default, it gives access to the default database and allows loading data, executing all procedures and user-defined functions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `PUBLIC` role cannot be dropped or revoked from any user, but the specific privileges for the role can be modified.
In contrast to the `PUBLIC` role, the other built-in roles can be granted, revoked, dropped, and re-created.
====

[[access-control-built-in-roles-public-list]]
=== Listing `PUBLIC` role privileges

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE PUBLIC PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result
[options="header,footer", width="100%", cols="m"]
|===
|command
|"GRANT ACCESS ON HOME DATABASE TO `PUBLIC`"
|"GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION * ON DBMS TO `PUBLIC`"
|"GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO `PUBLIC`"
|"GRANT LOAD ON ALL DATA TO `PUBLIC`"
a|Rows: 4
|===


[[access-control-built-in-roles-public-recreate]]
=== Recreating the `PUBLIC` role

The `PUBLIC` role can not be dropped and thus there is no need to recreate the role itself.
To restore the role to its original capabilities, two steps are needed.

First, all `GRANT` or `DENY` privileges on this role should be revoked (see output of `SHOW ROLE PUBLIC PRIVILEGES AS REVOKE COMMANDS` on what to revoke).
Secondly, run these queries:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ACCESS ON HOME DATABASE TO PUBLIC
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURES * ON DBMS TO PUBLIC
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT EXECUTE USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS * ON DBMS TO PUBLIC
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT LOAD ON ALL DATA TO PUBLIC
----

The resulting `PUBLIC` role now has the same privileges as the original built-in `PUBLIC` role.


[[access-control-built-in-roles-reader]]
== The `reader` role

The `reader` role can perform read-only queries on all graphs except for the `system` database.


[[access-control-built-in-roles-reader-list]]
=== Listing `reader` role privileges

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW ROLE reader PRIVILEGES AS COMMANDS
----

.Result

|===
|command
|"GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE * TO `reader`"
|"GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * NODE * TO `reader`"
|"GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * RELATIONSHIP * TO `reader`"
|"GRANT SHOW CONSTRAINT ON DATABASE * TO `reader`"
|"GRANT SHOW INDEX ON DATABASE * TO `reader`"

|===


[[access-control-built-in-roles-reader-recreate]]
=== Recreating the `reader` role

////
[source, cypher, role=test-setup]
----

----
////

To restore the role to its original capabilities two steps are needed.
First, execute `DROP ROLE reader`.
Secondly, run these queries:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE ROLE reader
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE * TO reader
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * TO reader
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT SHOW CONSTRAINT ON DATABASE * TO reader
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
GRANT SHOW INDEX ON DATABASE * TO reader
----

The resulting `reader` role now has the same privileges as the original built-in `reader` role.


[[access-control-built-in-roles-editor]]
== The `editor` role

The `editor` role can perform read and write operations on all graphs except for the `system` database, but it cannot create new labels, property keys or relationship types.

[[access-control-built-in-roles-editor-list]]
=== Listing `editor` role privileges

[source, cypher, role=noplay]

The resulting `editor` role now has the same privileges as the original built-in `editor` role.


[[access-control-built-in-roles-publisher]]
== The `publisher` role

The `publisher` role can do the same as xref:authentication-authorization/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-editor[`editor`], as well as create new labels, property keys and relationship types.

[[access-control-built-in-roles-admin]]
== The `admin` role

The `admin` role can do the same as the xref:authentication-authorization/built-in-roles.adoc#access-control-built-in-roles-architect[`architect`], as well as manage databases, aliases, users, roles and privileges.

The `admin` role can perform administrative tasks.
These include the rights to perform the following classes of tasks:

* Manage xref:authentication-authorization/database-administration.adoc[database privileges] to control the rights to perform actions on specific databases:
** Manage access to a database and the right to start and stop a database.
** Manage link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/indexes-for-search-performance/[indexes] and link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/constraints/[constraints].
** Allow the creation of labels, relationship types, or property names.
** Manage transactions.
* Manage xref:authentication-authorization/dbms-administration.adoc[DBMS privileges] to control the rights to perform actions on the entire system:
** Manage xref:database-administration/index.adoc[multiple databases].
** Manage xref:authentication-authorization/manage-users.adoc[users] and xref:authentication-authorization/manage-roles.adoc[roles].
** Change configuration parameters.
** Manage sub-graph privileges.
** Manage procedure security.
** Manage xref:authentication-authorization/load-privileges.adoc[load privileges] to control the rights to load data from external sources.

These rights are conferred using privileges that can be managed through the xref:authentication-authorization/manage-privileges.adoc#access-control-graph-privileges[`GRANT`, `DENY` and `REVOKE` commands].

If the built-in `admin` role has been altered or dropped and needs to be restored to its original state, see xref:authentication-authorization/password-and-user-recovery.adoc[Password and user recovery].

[[access-control-built-in-roles-admin-recreate]]
=== Recreating the `admin` role

To restore the role to its original capabilities two steps are needed.
First, execute `DROP ROLE admin`.
Secondly, run these queries:

// cannot test as it would require deleting the role the test user is logged with
