= Built-in roles
:description: This section describes the roles that come pre-defined with Neo4j. 

Neo4j provides built-in roles with default privileges. The built-in roles and the default privileges are:

[.compact]
`PUBLIC`::
* Access to the default database.
`reader`::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse and read on the data graph (all nodes, relationships, properties).
`editor`::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Write access limited to creating and changing *existing* property keys, node labels, and relationship types of the graph.
In other words, the `editor` role cannot add to the schema but can only make changes to already existing objects.
`publisher`::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
`architect`::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Create/drop/show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
`admin`::
* Access to all databases.
* Traverse, read, and write on the data graph.
* Create/drop/show indexes and constraints along with any other future schema constructs.
* View/terminate queries.
* Manage databases, users, roles, and privileges.


All users will be assigned the `PUBLIC` role, which by default does not give any rights or capabilities regarding the data, not even read privileges.
A user may have more than one assigned role, and the union of these determine what action(s) on the data may be undertaken by the user.

When an administrator suspends or deletes another user, the following rules apply:

* Administrators can suspend or delete any other user (including other administrators), but not themselves.
* The user will no longer be able to log back in (until re-activated by an administrator if suspended).
* There is no need to remove assigned roles from a user prior to deleting the user.

[NOTE]
--
Deleting a user will not automatically terminate associated connections, sessions, transactions, or queries.

The set of actions on the data and database prescribed by each role are described below.
The subset of the functionality which is available with Community Edition is also included:
