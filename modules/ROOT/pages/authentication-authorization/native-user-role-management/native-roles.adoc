:description: This section describes native roles in Neo4j. 

Neo4j provides the following native roles:

[.compact]
`reader`::
* Read-only access to the data graph (all nodes, relationships, properties).
`editor`::
* Read/write access to the data graph.
* Write access limited to creating and changing *existing* property keys, node labels, and relationship types of the graph.
In other words, the `editor` role cannot add to the schema but can only make changes to already existing objects.
`publisher`::
* Read/write access to the data graph.
`architect`::
* Read/write access to the data graph.
* Set/delete access to indexes along with any other future schema constructs.
[[admin-role]]`admin`::
* Read/write access to the data graph.
* Set/delete access to indexes along with any other future schema constructs.
* View/terminate queries.

We detail below the set of actions on the data and database prescribed by each role.
The subset of the functionality which is available with Community Edition is also included:

A xref:authentication-authorization/terminology.adoc#term-user[user] who has no assigned roles will not have any rights or capabilities regarding the data, not even read privileges.
A user may have more than one assigned role, and the union of these determine what action(s) on the data may be undertaken by the user.

When an administrator suspends or deletes another user, the following rules apply:

* Administrators can suspend or delete any other user (including other administrators), but not themselves.
* Deleting a user terminates all of the userâ€™s running queries and sessions.
* All queries currently running for the deleted user are rolled back.
* The user will no longer be able to log back in (until re-activated by an administrator if suspended).
* There is no need to remove assigned roles from a user prior to deleting the user.
