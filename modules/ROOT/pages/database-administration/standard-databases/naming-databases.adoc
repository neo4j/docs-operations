= Naming rules for databases

Database names are subject to the standard Cypher restrictions on valid identifiers.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/syntax/naming[Cypher Manual -> Naming rules and recommendations].

Naming rules for databases are as follows:

* Length must be between 3 and 63 characters.
* The first character of a name must be an ASCII alphabetic or numeric character.
Support for database names starting with a numeric character is available from Neo4j 2025.01.
* Subsequent characters must be ASCII alphabetic or numeric characters, dots or dashes; `[a..z][0..9].-`.
* Names cannot end with dots or dashes.
* Names are case-insensitive and normalized to lowercase.
* Names that begin with an underscore and with the prefix `system` are reserved for internal use.

[NOTE]
====
The `-` (dash) and `.` (dot) characters are not legal in Cypher variables.
Names containing a `-` or that begin with a numeric character must be enclosed within backticks.
For example, `CREATE DATABASE ++`main-db`++` is a valid database name.
In Cypher 25, names that contain a dot (`.`) must be quoted in backticks.
However, using dots in database names is not recommended, as it makes it difficult to determine if a dot is part of the database name or a delimiter for a database alias in a composite database.
A future version of Neo4j may entirely disallow database names with dots.
====

It is possible to create an alias to refer to an existing database to avoid these restrictions.
