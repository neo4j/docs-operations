= Delete databases

Databases can be deleted by using the command `DROP DATABASE`.
Note that all database aliases must be dropped before dropping a database.

== Syntax

[options="header", width="100%", cols="1m,5a"]
|===
| Command | Syntax

| DROP DATABASE

[source, syntax, role="noheader"]
----
DROP [COMPOSITE] DATABASE name [IF EXISTS] [{DUMP\|DESTROY} [DATA]] [WAIT [n [SEC[OND[S]]]]\|NOWAIT]
----

== Examples

[[delete-database]]
=== Delete a database

To delete the database `customers`, run the following command:

[source, cypher]
----
DROP DATABASE customers
----

[NOTE]
====
Both standard databases and composite databases can be deleted using this command.
====

The `DROP DATABASE` command removes a database entirely.
Therefore, it no longer shows up in the listing provided by the command `SHOW DATABASES`:

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name
----

.Result
[role="queryresult]
----
+---------------------+
| name                |
+---------------------+
| "movies"            |
| "neo4j"             |
| "system"            |
+---------------------+

[[delete-databases-existing]]
=== Delete a database with `IF{nbsp}EXISTS`

The `DROP DATABASE` command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to fail with an error if the database does not exist.

Appending `IF EXISTS` to the command ensures that no error is returned and nothing happens if the database does not exist.

It always returns an error if there is an existing alias that targets the database.
In that case, the alias needs to be dropped before dropping the database.

DROP DATABASE customers IF EXISTS

[[manage-databases-dump]]
=== Delete a database with `DUMP DATA` or `DESTROY DATA`

By appending `DUMP DATA` to the command `DROP DATABASE`, you can create a dump of the store files before deleting the database:

[source, cypher]
----
DROP DATABASE movies DUMP DATA
----

These dumps are equivalent to those produced by xref:backup-restore/offline-backup.adoc[`neo4j-admin database dump`] and can be similarly restored using the xref:backup-restore/restore-dump.adoc[`neo4j-admin database load`] command.

In Neo4j, dumps can be stored in the directory specified by the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.directories.dumps.root[`server.directories.dumps.root`] setting (by default, the path for storing dumps is xref:configuration/file-locations.adoc#data[`<neo4j-home>/data/dumps`]).

The option `DESTROY DATA` explicitly requests the default behavior of the command.

[[delete-existing-db-with-dump]]
=== Delete a database with `IF{nbsp}EXISTS` and  `DUMP DATA`/ `DESTROY DATA`

The options `IF EXISTS` and `DUMP DATA`/ `DESTROY DATA` can also be combined.

An example could look like this:

[source, cypher]
----
DROP DATABASE customers IF EXISTS DUMP DATA
----
