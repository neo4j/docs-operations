= Create databases

Neo4j supports the management of multiple databases within the same DBMS.
The metadata for these databases, including the associated security model, is maintained in a special database called the `system` database.
All multi-database administrative commands must be run against the `system` database.
These administrative commands are automatically routed to the `system` database when connected to the DBMS over Bolt.

You can create a database using the Cypher command `CREATE DATABASE`.
The initial contents of the database depend on the state of the server and the options provided to the command.
When no additional options are provided, `CREATE DATABASE` will attempt to mount any pre-existing store files in place (e.g., as the result of restoring a backup).
If no pre-existing store files are available, it will create an empty database.

[NOTE]
====
Database names are subject to the rules specified in xref:database-administration/standard-databases/naming-databases.adoc[Database names] section.
Having dots (`.`) in the database names is not recommended.
This is due to the difficulty of determining if a dot is part of the database name or a delimiter for a database alias in a composite database.
====

`block` is the default format for all newly created databases as long as they do not have the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] setting specified. +
If you want to change it, you can set a new value for the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_db.format[`db.format`] configuration in the _neo4j.conf_ file. +
Alternatively, you can set the store format of new databases using the `CREATE DATABASE databasename OPTIONS {storeFormat: 'the-new-format'}` command.
However, if the store is seeded with `seedURI`, `existingDataSeedServer` or `existingDataSeedInstance`, or if the command is being used to mount pre-existing store files already present on the disk, they will use their current store format without any alterations.

See xref:database-internals/store-formats.adoc[Store formats], for more details about available database store formats in Neo4j.

The `CREATE DATABASE` command can have a map of options, e.g. `OPTIONS {key: 'value'}`.

[options="header"]
|===

| Key | Value | Description

| `existingData`
| `use`
|
Controls how the system handles existing data on disk when creating the database.
Currently, this is only supported with `existingDataSeedInstance`, `existingDataSeedServer` and `seedURI`, and must be set to `use`, which indicates the existing data files should be used for the new database.


|`existingDataSeedServer`

`existingDataSeedInstance` label:deprecated[deprecated in 5.25]
| ID of the cluster server
|
Defines which server is used for seeding the data of the created database.
The server ID can be found in the `serverId` column after running `SHOW SERVERS`.
Replaced by `existingDataSeedServer`.

| `seedURI`
| URI to a backup or a dump from an existing database.
|
Defines an identical seed from an external source which will be used to seed all servers.
For more information, see xref::database-administration/standard-databases/seed-from-uri.adoc[Seed from a URI].

| `seedConfig`
| Comma-separated list of configuration values.
|

| `seedCredentials` label:deprecated[Deprecated in 5.26]
| credentials
|
Defines credentials that need to be passed into certain seed providers.
It is recommended to use the `CloudSeedProvider` seed provider, which does not require this configuration when seeding from cloud storage.
For more information see xref::database-administration/standard-databases/seed-from-uri.adoc#cloud-seed-provider[CloudSeedProvider].

| `txLogEnrichment`
| `FULL` \| `DIFF` \| `OFF`
|
Defines the level of enrichment applied to transaction logs for Change Data Capture (CDC) purposes.

For details about enrichment mode, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cdc/current/get-started/self-managed/#_modify_a_databases_cdc_mode[Change Data Capture Manual -> Enable CDC on self-managed instances -> Modify a databaseâ€™s CDC mode].

| `storeFormat`
| `aligned` \| `standard` \| `high_limit` \| `block`
|
Defines the store format if the database created is new.
`high_limit` and `standard` formats are deprecated from 5.23.
For more information on store formats, see xref::database-internals/store-formats.adoc[Store formats].

If the store is seeded with `seedURI`, `existingDataSeedInstance` or `existingDataSeedServer`, or if the command is used to mount pre-existing store files already present on the disk, they will retain their current store format without any modifications.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Starting from Neo4j 2025.01, you can use `existingData`, `seedURI`, `seedConfig`, and `seedCredentials` options together with the `CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE` command.

The `existingDataSeedInstance` and `existingDataSeedServer` are still not supported with the `CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE` command.
More details about seeding options can be found in xref::clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed[Seed a cluster].

|`existingDataSeedServer`
| ID of the cluster server
|
Defines which server is used for seeding the data of the created database.
The server ID can be found in the `serverId` column after running `SHOW SERVERS`.

| `seedURI`
| URI to a backup, a folder that contains backup artifacts or a dump from an existing database.
|
Defines a seed from an external source, which will be used to seed all servers.

| `seedConfig`
| Comma-separated list of configuration values.
|
For more information see xref::clustering/databases.adoc#cluster-seed-uri[Seed from URI].

| `txLogEnrichment`
| `FULL` \| `DIFF` \| `OFF`
|
Defines the level of enrichment applied to transaction logs for Change Data Capture (CDC) purposes.

For details about enrichment mode, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cdc/current/get-started/self-managed/#set-enrichment-mode/[Change Data Capture Manual -> Enable CDC on self-managed instances -> Set the enrichment mode].

| `storeFormat`
| `aligned` \| `standard` \| `high_limit` \| `block`
|
Defines the store format if the database created is new.
`high_limit` and `standard` formats are deprecated from 5.23.
For more information on store formats, see xref::database-internals/store-formats.adoc[Store formats].

If the store is seeded with `seedURI` or `existingDataSeedServer`, or if the command is used to mount pre-existing store files already present on the disk, they will retain their current store format without any modifications.

| `seedRestoreUntil`
| Datetime or transaction id. E.g. `datetime("2025-01-01T12:15:00.000+0100")` or `123456`
|
If you are passing a `seedURI` that leads to a backup chain, including differential backups, you can choose to not apply all the transactions in the differential backups.
To seed up to a specific date, specify a `datetime`.
This will seed the database with transactions committed before the provided timestamp.
To seed up to a specific transaction ID, specify a transaction ID.
This will seed the database with transactions up to, but not including the specified transaction.

| `seedSourceDatabase` label:new[Introduced in 2025.06]
| A source database name
|
If the `seedURI` points to a folder containing backups for multiple databases, you can specify the database name to filter the artifacts.

| `existingData` label:deprecated[Deprecated in 2025.06]
| `use`
|
Included for backward compatibility only, has no effect and will be removed in a future version.

[NOTE]
====
In Cypher 25, the options `seedCredentials` and `existingDataSeedInstance` have been removed, while the `existingData` option is now deprecated and has no effect.

=====

The following examples show how to create a database using the `CREATE DATABASE` command with various options.

== Create a database

To create a database named `actors`, use the command `CREATE DATABASE` followed by the name of this database.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE actors
----

When you create a database, it shows up in the listing provided by the command `SHOW DATABASES`:

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW DATABASES YIELD name
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]
----
+-------------+
| name        |
+-------------+
| "actors"    |
| "movies"    |
| "neo4j"     |
| "system"    |
+-------------+
----


== Create a database with xref:database-administration/standard-databases/wait-options.adoc[`WAIT`]

[.tabbed-example]
=====
[role=include-with-cypher-5]
======
Sub-clause `WAIT` allows you to specify a time limit for the command to complete and return.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE slow WAIT 5 SECONDS
----

.Result
[role="queryresult"]
----
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| address          | state      | message     | success |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| "localhost:7687" | "CaughtUp" | "caught up" | TRUE    |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
----

The `success` column provides an aggregate status of whether or not the command is considered successful.
Thus, every row has the same value, determined on a successful completion without a timeout.
======
[role=include-with-cypher-25 label--new-2025.06]
======
Sub-clause `WAIT` allows you to specify a time limit for the command to complete and return.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE slow WAIT 5 SECONDS
----

.Result
[role="queryresult"]
----
info: Server `ServerId{b55c6551}` at address `server1:7687` has caught up.
03N85 (Neo.ClientNotification.Cluster.ServerCaughtUp)

info: Server `ServerId{a9e7e8f1}` at address `server2:7687` has caught up.
03N85 (Neo.ClientNotification.Cluster.ServerCaughtUp)

info: Server `ServerId{0f7cb48e}` at address `server3:7687` has caught up.
03N85 (Neo.ClientNotification.Cluster.ServerCaughtUp)
----

The command returns a notification for each server in the cluster to indicate the status of that command on that server.
In this example, all three cluster members have returned `03N85 (Neo.ClientNotification.Cluster.ServerCaughtUp)`, which indicates that the server has applied the command successfully and is up to date.
======
=====

== Create a database with `IF NOT EXISTS` or `OR REPLACE`

The `CREATE DATABASE` command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to fail with an error if the database already exists.
There are two ways to circumvent this behavior.

First, appending `IF NOT EXISTS` to the command ensures that no error is returned and that nothing happens if the database already exists.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE actors IF NOT EXISTS
----

Second, adding `OR REPLACE` to the command deletes any existing database and creates a new one.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE actors
----

This is equivalent to running `DROP DATABASE actors IF EXISTS` followed by `CREATE DATABASE actors`.

Keep in mind that using `CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE` also removes indexes and constraints.
To preserve them, run the following Cypher commands before the `CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE` and save their outputs:

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD createStatement AS statement
----

[source, cypher]
----
SHOW INDEXES YIELD createStatement, owningConstraint
WHERE owningConstraint IS NULL
RETURN createStatement AS statement
----

The behavior of `IF NOT EXISTS` and `OR REPLACE` apply to both standard and composite databases (e.g. a composite database may replace a standard database or another composite database).

[NOTE]
====
The `IF NOT EXISTS` and `OR REPLACE` parts of these commands cannot be used together.
====

[role=label--new-2025.06]
== Create a database with `DEFAULT LANGUAGE`

You can set the default Cypher version for a database when creating it.
If not specified, the default language for the database is set to the default language of the DBMS.
For example:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE actors DEFAULT LANGUAGE CYPHER 25
----
This command creates a database named `actors` with the default Cypher version set to 25.
