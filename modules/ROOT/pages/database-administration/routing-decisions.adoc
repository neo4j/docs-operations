= Query routing decisions
:description: This page describes in detail how queries are routed to databases for execution.

Query routing is the process of deciding which Cypher executor (database) should be used and at which physical location the query should be executed.
Every query that arrives at a Neo4j server, over the bolt protocol from a driver, undergoes the process described here.

== Routing decision tree

Before the query is executed, these are the decisions taken during query routing stage:

Step 1: Determine the name of the target database::
   Pick the first of these that has a value:
. link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/clauses/use[Cypher `USE` clause]
** Note that link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/administration/databases[administration commands]  implicitly have `USE system`.
. link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/drivers-apis/[Driver session database]
. xref:database-administration/index.adoc#manage-databases-default[Home or default database]
Step 2: Reuse open transaction::
* If there is an already open transaction to the target database, local or remote, then proceed to step 6.
* If not, then proceed to step 3.
Step 3: Determine the type of the target database (execution context type)::
* If the target database is a database in this DBMS, then the context type is _Internal_.
* If the target database is a xref::database-administration/composite-databases/concepts.adoc[Composite database], then the context type is _Composite_. +
+
[NOTE]
====
This also allows the query to target multiple databases.
====
+
* If the target database is a xref:database-administration/aliases/manage-aliases-standard-databases.adoc[Remote Alias], then the context type is _External_.
Step 4: Determine the location of execution::
* If context type is _Internal_
** and the URI scheme is `bolt://` (routing disabled), then location is _Local_.
** and the transaction mode is `READ`
*** and the database is hosted on this server, then location is _Local_.
*** and the database is hosted on another sever
**** and xref:clustering/setup/routing.adoc#clustering-routing[Server-side routing] is xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.routing.enabled[enabled], then location is _Remote_ (using the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.routing.advertised_address[routing advertised address] of that server).
**** if not, then fail.
** if the transaction mode is `WRITE`
*** and the local server is the leader for the database, then location is _Local_.
*** and another server is the leader for the database
**** and xref:clustering/setup/routing.adoc#clustering-routing[Server-side routing] is xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_dbms.routing.enabled[enabled], then location is _Remote_ (using the xref:configuration/configuration-settings.adoc#config_server.routing.advertised_address[routing advertised address] of that server).
**** and xref:clustering/setup/routing.adoc#clustering-routing[Server-side routing] is _not_ enabled, then fail.
* If context type is _Composite_, then location is _Local_ (for this part of the query).
* If context type is _External_, then location is _Remote_ (using the xref:database-administration/aliases/remote-database-alias-configuration.adoc[URI and database] given in the configuration).
Step 5: Open a transaction::
* If location is _Local_, then open a transaction to the database on this server.
* If location is _Remote_, then open a driver transaction to the database using the URI determined in step 4.
Step 6: Execute query::
* Execute the query in the open transaction.
