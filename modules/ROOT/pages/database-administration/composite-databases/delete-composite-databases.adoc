Composite databases can be deleted using the command `DROP COMPOSITE DATABASE name`.
This command will fail if the targeted database is not a composite database.

It is also possible to use the shorter command `DROP DATABASE name` for composite databases, but this command will drop any database and not fail in case the targeted database is not a composite database.
